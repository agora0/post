Due to the drought weather on this small island in the season of Autumn, I need to find some fresh fountain for getting the plenty drinking water.

So I had better to find the other place for seeking the fountain and prevent myself to strive the fresh water with those trees. Surprisingly, Mermaid E. discovered a small fountain very nearing the island under the sea, so I made some wood pipes and a water drawing stick to induct the fresh water up to the island from that fountain below the sea.&nbsp; Mermaid E. was not a normal mermaid, she had been always drinking&nbsp;&nbsp;the fresh water as I doing from the beginning of The Story of I.E..&nbsp; Actually, to drink the fresh water always made me feel free, …… of course, not drank too much within a short time. When I looked back the whole thing about solving the fresh water supply during the dry weather on the small island, I found this word &quot;draw&quot; seems like combined by a kind of pronouncement of the Hanese word &quot;震&quot; and the first character of &quot;water&quot;.

Maybe this simple tool for drawing the water was also a type of&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;雷水解&quot;, so I didn’t have to wait for the fresh water poured down by the thundering rain.

You can try your best to satisfy your own willingness, even don’t have to concern others’ ideologies. But to the public case, it’s not the same. Most of the times, there’s a long list involved the strict standards and processes for making the final decision in the public case.&quot; 少數人參予的事情往往比較容易取得共識，眾多人參予的事情就很難滿足每個人、也不容易面面俱到。在每個人都希望收益大於損失，而自己又不計得失、大量付出的情況下，要如何避免在解決問題的過程中造成本身過度的消耗和損失呢？ &quot;That’s why the next two quas 損 and 益 were going to talk about loss and profit, or decreasing and increasing. Sometimes the awesome commercial businesses were built on the great dreams, and which might be invested by many dreamers - those who had the same dreams.&quot; &quot;If you have no dream, then you will not feel any loss or profit in the future.&quot; &quot;But many people didn’t like to talk about the dream, they thought the dream is not real.&quot;&nbsp; &quot;They just changed their dream to the other words, such like: will, willing, intend, aspire, wish, worry, hope, eager, desire, want, need, the chasing, the longing,…… and the praying.&quot; These days I tried to solve a problem of my villa house. Due to the drought weather on this small island in the season of Autumn, I need to find some fresh fountain for getting the plenty drinking water. Of course I knew the fountain possibly located under the land of trees, but many trees seemed to lose their vitality in such drought atmosphere. So I had better to find the other place for seeking the fountain and prevent myself to strive the fresh water with those trees. Surprisingly, Mermaid E. discovered a small fountain very nearing the island under the sea, so I made some wood pipes and a water drawing stick to induct the fresh water up to the island from that fountain below the sea.&nbsp; Mermaid E. was not a normal mermaid, she had been always drinking&nbsp;&nbsp;the fresh water as I doing from the beginning of The Story of I.E..&nbsp; Actually, to drink the fresh water always made me feel free, …… of course, not drank too much within a short time. When I looked back the whole thing about solving the fresh water supply during the dry weather on the small island, I found this word &quot;draw&quot; seems like combined by a kind of pronouncement of the Hanese word &quot;震&quot; and the first character of &quot;water&quot;. And, &quot;震&quot; is just the other name of &quot;雷&quot; in the I.E. Scripture. Maybe this simple tool for drawing the water was also a type of&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;雷水解&quot;, so I didn’t have to wait for the fresh water poured down by the thundering rain. No matter what, I have already easily solved my problem with &quot;解渴&quot;.
