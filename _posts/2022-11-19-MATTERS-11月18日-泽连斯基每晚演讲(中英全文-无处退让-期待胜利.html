<p>01</p><p>—</p><p><br></p><p><strong>泽连斯基演讲</strong></p><p><br></p><figure class="image"><img src="https://assets.matters.news/embed/4e61d85c-0d6c-42b8-9a3d-8d63f3468a8f.png" data-asset-id="4e61d85c-0d6c-42b8-9a3d-8d63f3468a8f" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption></figure><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>乌克兰同胞们，祝你们身体健康！</p><p><br></p><p>能源工作人员整天都在努力恢复正常供电的技术可能性，今天紧急停电的次数已经大大减少了。</p><p><br></p><p>截至傍晚，在大多数继续停电的地区，按小时排的供电时间表已经生效。敖德萨地区和基辅大范围地进行了紧急停电。</p><p><br></p><p>有17个地区和首都的能源供应困难局面依然存在。基辅地区和基辅市，敖德萨地区、文尼察地区和捷尔诺波尔地区都非常困难。</p><p><br></p><p>今天在赫尔松开设了特殊的“无敌站点”。最先的两个点。还会有更多。</p><p>在城市恢复供电时，人们可以为手机充电、取暖、喝茶和寻求帮助。我们还在那里提供了通信服务，有“星链”等。</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>我们知道这对人们来说非常困难，因为占领者在逃离之前摧毁了一切。</p><p>但我们会连接一切，恢复一切。</p><p><br></p><p>欧盟委员会副主席东布罗夫斯基斯今天在基辅。</p><p>我们与他特别讨论了能源问题，还详细讨论了乌克兰与欧盟的金融合作、我国年底前和明年的融资需求。</p><p>今年，我们预计会有两笔宏观金融援助——11 月的 25 亿欧元和 12 月初的 5 亿欧元。</p><p>我们还讨论了可能在欧洲层面实施的针对俄罗斯的新制裁。</p><p><br></p><p>我今天与爱尔兰的学生社区进行了交谈——一个从根本上支持我们的国家。尽管它在军事上是一个中立国家，但爱尔兰坚决捍卫欧洲价值观并在政治和人道主义上帮助我们。</p><p><br></p><p>我向爱尔兰人提出了两个要求。一是在泛欧层面宣传加强对俄制裁的必要性，二是帮助我们传播有关乌克兰事件和俄罗斯恐怖活动的真相。</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>我还在加拿大哈利法克斯的安全论坛上向与会者发表了讲话，该论坛是世界性安全论坛之一。</p><p>我再次提出乌克兰和平方案，并邀请加拿大和我们的其他伙伴们为自己选择和平方案中、他们可以在其中尽可能发挥领导作用的一个部分，</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>这就是我们提出恢复和平建议的方式要旨。</p><p>我们将它们分解为各个要素——俄罗斯的侵略包含了哪些。我们尽一切努力消除这当中每一个要素，并最终击败侵略者。</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>每天，我都会收到来自世界各地对我们这种做法的非常积极的反馈——主要国家领导人支持乌克兰的建设性。我相信我们将能够实施我们的和平方案。</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>顿涅茨克地区的激烈战斗一直持续到今天，敌对行动没有片刻缓和或停息。就在昨天，大约一百次俄罗斯的进攻在顿涅茨克地区被击退。</p><p>我们所有坚守在顿巴斯的战士都是真正的英雄。</p><p><br></p><p>今天，我要特别关注目前在顿涅茨克地区开展活动的哈尔科夫和苏梅分遣队的边防警卫。他们的迫击炮帮了大忙，让入侵者无法休息。干得好，伙计们！谢谢！</p><p><br></p><p>我还要感谢国民警卫队第 4 作战旅的战士们，他们在巴赫穆特方向保护乌克兰。机敏的主动性和顽强的毅力是能产生极其有用结果的两个品质。</p><p><br></p><p>我们前线的任何地方都不会向敌人屈服。我们到处还击，我们处处坚守阵地。我们正在为未来某些地区的胜利做准备。</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>我今天与土耳其总统埃尔多安进行了交谈。感谢他为延期我们的粮食出口计划所做的努力。</p><p><br></p><p>我们还讨论了我们新的人道主义计划——“来自乌克兰的粮食”的细节。</p><p>我希望土耳其能够参与实施。</p><p>当然，关于安全合作和能源形势也进行了交流。</p><p><br></p><p>明天我们将度过非常活跃的一天，而不是休息日。我们期待给乌克兰带来的讯息和机会。我们已经在为它们准备合适的土壤。</p><p><br></p><p>今天我还想再说一件事——祝贺你们。在职业日祝贺乌克兰武装部队的所有军士。今天，无论是在军队还是在社会上，都说了很多好心话。</p><p><br></p><p>军士是确保指挥官和士兵之间真正团结和理解的人。军士团是陆军真正的骨干，我感谢我们所有不辜负这些话的军士。</p><p>感谢目前在我们国防军中服役的每一个人！</p><p><br></p><p>感谢所有将保卫乌克兰作为个人命运一部分的人！</p><p><br></p><p>荣耀归于我们的英雄！</p><p>永远怀念和尊崇为乌克兰人民的自由而献出生命的英雄！</p><p>荣耀归于乌克兰！</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Nowhere on the frontline do we give in to the enemy, in certain areas we are preparing future successes - address by the President of Ukraine</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!</strong></p><p>All day long, the energy staff worked to restore the normal technical possibility of electricity supply, as a result today there are already significantly fewer emergency shutdowns.</p><p>As of the evening, in most regions where shutdowns continue, stabilization hourly schedules were in effect. Emergency shutdowns were used to a greater extent in the Odesa region and Kyiv.</p><p>The difficult situation with energy supply persists in a total of 17 regions and in the capital. Kyiv region and Kyiv, it’s very difficult in the Odesa region, and also the Vinnytsia region and Ternopil region.</p><p>Special "Points of Invincibility" were opened in Kherson today. The first two points. There will be more.</p><p>While electricity is restored in the city, people can charge their phones, stay warm, drink tea and get help. We have provided communication service there, there are "Starlinks", etc.</p><p>We know that it is very difficult for people, because the occupiers destroyed everything before fleeing. But we will connect everything, restore everything.</p><p>Vice-President of the European Commission Dombrovskis was in Kyiv today. We talked with him, in particular, about energy. Financial cooperation between Ukraine and the European Union, the financing needs of our country until the end of the year and in the next year were also discussed in detail.</p><p>This year, we expect two tranches of macro-financial aid - EUR 2.5 billion in November and EUR 0.5 billion in early December.</p><p>We also discussed new sanctions against Russia, which may be introduced at the European level.</p><p>I spoke today with the student community of Ireland - a country that supports us fundamentally. Although it is a neutral country militarily, Ireland strongly defends European values and helps us politically and humanitarianly.</p><p>I made two requests to the Irish. The first is to promote at the pan-European level the need to strengthen sanctions against Russia. The second is to help us spread the truth about the events in Ukraine and about Russian terror.</p><p>I also addressed the participants of the security forum in Halifax, Canada, which is one of the world's security forums. Once again, I presented the Ukrainian peace formula and invited Canada and our other partners to choose for themselves a component of the peace formula in which they can show their leadership as much as possible.</p><p>This is the point of the way we present our proposals for restoring peace.</p><p>We have broken them down into elements - what Russian aggression consists of. And we do everything to neutralize each of these elements and to neutralize the aggressor because of it.</p><p>Every day, I receive very positive feedback from the world about this approach of ours - major leaders support Ukrainian constructiveness. And I believe that we will be able to implement our peace formula.</p><p>The fierce fighting in the Donetsk region continues to this day, there has been no alleviation of hostilities or respite. About a hundred Russian attacks were repelled in the Donetsk region only yesterday. All our warriors who are holding out in Donbas are true heroes.</p><p>Today, I would like to pay particular attention to the border guards of the Kharkiv and Sumy detachments, who are currently operating in the Donetsk region. Their mortars help a lot, giving the invaders no rest. Nice job, guys! Thank you!</p><p>I also thank the warriors of the 4th operational brigade of the National Guard, which protects Ukraine in the direction of Bakhmut. Smart initiative and persistence are two things that produce extremely useful results.</p><p>Nowhere on the frontline do we give in to the enemy. We respond everywhere, we hold positions everywhere. We are preparing future successes in certain areas.</p><p>I spoke today with the President of Türkiye Erdoğan. Thanked him for the efforts to extend our grain export initiative.</p><p>We also discussed the details of our new humanitarian initiative Grain from Ukraine. I hope that Türkiye will join its implementation.</p><p>Of course, attention was paid to both security cooperation and energy situation.</p><p>Tomorrow we will have a very active day, not a day off at all. We are expecting news and opportunities for Ukraine. And we are already preparing the appropriate soil for them.</p><p>And today I want to say one more thing - congratulations. Congratulations to all sergeants of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on their professional day. Today, many kind words were said both in the army and in society.</p><p>Sergeants are truly the people who ensure real unity and understanding between commanders and soldiers. The sergeant corps is the true backbone of the Army, and I thank all of our sergeants who live up to those words.</p><p>Thank you to each and everyone who is currently serving in our defense forces!</p><p>Thank you to everyone who made the defense of Ukraine a part of their personal destiny!</p><p><strong>Glory to our heroes!</strong></p><p><strong>Eternal memory and honor to those who gave their lives for the freedom of Ukrainians!</strong></p><p><strong>Glory to Ukraine!</strong></p><p><br></p><figure class="image"><img src="https://assets.matters.news/embed/0a4ce59e-e631-4c47-9247-dabcb993418f.png" data-asset-id="0a4ce59e-e631-4c47-9247-dabcb993418f" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>国防部11月18日战报</strong></p><p><br></p>
