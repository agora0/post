<p>My favourite festival is Durian Day. It is because this is a festival that I created by myself.</p>
<p>Durian Day doesn’t have a long history. It is just a day created for durian lovers to eat and enjoy durian all day long.</p>
<p>Great. Now you know all the facts, write it down, memorize it, and tell all your families and friends.</p>
<p>And guess what? Today is the durian day! My grandfather had been growing a mega durian for the whole year. Now it is as big as a truck wheel.  And now it is time for a happy durian feat.</p>
