And so it's not so much like the Ukrainian language. I mean, they have the Ukrainian language, and that does make them different. It's their language and it has a beautiful literary tradition and it's a beautiful spoken language. But they also have the capacity which the Russians lack, which we lack, is the ability to code switch. I shouldn’t say we because some Americans can, there are plenty of Americans that are bilingual. But Ukraine is basically a whole nation of code switchers. And it's that thing also which makes them a little bit different and hard for us to understand.</blockquote><p>欲知現狀，必具史識。普京卻成長於一九七零年代，正值蘇聯努力抹走烏克蘭特色之時。因此普京會視普天之下皆俄羅斯，會覺得人人心底都渴望做俄國人操俄國語，也就不足奇怪了。</p><blockquote>But when Brezhnev takes control from the late 60s and especially from the early 70s forwards, ou have a policy of a very deliberate Russification in Ukraine. And it's at that moment the 1970s that are so important for understanding the present, because that's when people like Putin grew up. You know, so Putin's perspective that everything is basically Russian and like, you know, eveyone really speaks Russian, and even if they seem not to, they really want to. That's a very 1970s perspective on all of this.</blockquote><p>所謂烏克蘭的特色當然非烏克蘭獨有。受大國壓迫的角落天下何其多？</p>
