<div class="draft--imgNormal draft-block"><div><div style="height:400px" class="image-block-prerender" data-src="https://images.vocus.cc/7a1afe94-2a8e-487d-918a-fc5521681c80.jpg" data-width="722" data-height="384" data-position="center"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption draft-block" style="cursor:text;display:block"></figcaption></div></div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left"><span style="font-weight: bold; ">亨，利貞，取女吉。--</span> 山丘為何出水流？湖澤為何起波濤？……山丘上也可能有積水的湖澤，湖澤下也可能有起伏的山丘。當你無意之間感到高興、聚精會神的傾心於一位讓你覺得有趣的女子，甚至不期而遇的結識她、喜歡她，她的部份特質很可能正是你自己潛在的部份性格呢！......無意之間發生的遙感連結或無線電波般的射頻收發效應就是所謂的感應，就是所謂的「咸」。人體水份中來自鹽類、鹹性或弱鹼性物質 (weak alkali material) 成分的電解質產生的神經傳導物質所造成的快速訊息傳遞，很可能就是感應現象發生的原因之一。<span style="font-weight: bold; ">(P.S. 此處「取」解爲「趣」，有「趨向某個見聞」之意。)<br><br></span></div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left"><span style="font-weight: bold; ">初六：咸其拇。</span>/<span style="font-weight: bold; "> 變卦澤火革 --</span> 嬰兒隨著不斷成長，潮濕柔軟的皮膚也開始逐漸乾燥，有時候他們頻頻吸吮拇指、用弱鹼性的唾液潤濕皮膚，可能藉此和不在身邊的母親有所感應。水能導電，甚至能隔空傳遞微弱的電訊，但是當身體缺乏水份、酸痛緊繃的時候，感應能力也會隨之而減弱。</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left"><span style="font-weight: bold; ">六二：咸其腓，凶，居吉。</span>/<span style="font-weight: bold; "> 變卦澤風大過 -- </span>學步的幼兒試著走路，雙腳需要一段時間彼此適應和協調，纔能走得穩、走得順，所以剛開始總是行動遲緩、頭腦不斷盤算。此時腦神經和身體四肢的連結、方向感和平衡感的建立，正在逐步而全面的發展，最好在安全的居室裡活動比較妥當吧！......步行時，雙腿肌肉跟著活動，腳步邁出適當而不過度的步伐、很有默契的互相牽引而不絆倒彼此，這不也算是一種感應嗎？<span style="font-weight: bold; ">(P.S. 此處「凶」解爲「頭腦的盤算」、calculation。）</span></div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left"><span style="font-weight: bold; ">九三：咸其股，執其隨，往吝。</span>/<span style="font-weight: bold; "> 變卦澤地萃 -- </span>身體中的每一股肌肉、每一個部份都是互相感應的，每當作出一個動作時，身體中的各個部份也會彼此互應相隨、同步調整和變化。如果執意想要控制壓抑某個部份同步進行的調整和變化，長久以後可能會造成身體機能發生遲頓和障礙呢！身體由大量的細胞聚集組織在一起，又經由神經脈絡互通訊息，正是所謂的牽一髮而動全身啊！</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left"><span style="font-weight: bold; ">九四：貞吉，悔無，憧憧往來，朋從爾思。</span>/<span style="font-weight: bold; "> 變卦水山蹇 -- </span>藉由感應的方式來偵測事物所得到的結果，如果常常準確無誤、沒有差錯，往往會引起更多憧憬和想像，就連朋友都可能希望從相似的虛擬思考中得到有關未來的建議或啟示，甚至把許多資金投入虛擬想像的領域。然而就在這時候，身體的感應力也可能如同水流在高山上凍結一樣，為了保住身體需要的神經傳導物質而阻塞停頓了。<span style="font-weight: bold; ">(P.S. 漢字「爾」的本意可能有信物、替代、相似、近似、彌補、補充、填充、理想、模擬、虛擬、擬真的意思，相當於 English 中的 similar、virtual、virtue 等等，衍生出「邇、璽、彌、瀰、鑈、濔、禰、薾、儞、隬......」等字，也有「信者」、「信眾」、「你們」、「古字『尒』的複數」之意。)</span></div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left"><span style="font-weight: bold; ">九五：咸其脢，無悔。</span>/<span style="font-weight: bold; "> 變卦雷山小過 -- </span>兩心相通、兩情相悅，就像雷電和山峰在某種催化作用之下，瞬間發生聯繫感應一樣，這有什麼晦澀難懂的呢？好笑的事情會讓人情不自矜的會心一笑，就算是忍住不笑，還是會突然爆笑開來、甚至引起一場小小的誤會，這是發生感應的必然現象啊！</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left"><span style="font-weight: bold; ">上六：咸其輔頰舌。</span>/<span style="font-weight: bold; "> 變卦天山遯 -- </span>為了輔助感應或感情的表達，臉部兩頰作出特別誇張的表情，甚至費了許多唇舌去解釋和說明，這樣反而褪去了想像的空間和幽默的境界。笑話在經過解釋之後，往往就不那麼好笑了！<br></div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"Frozen water as ice and snow, which gathered on the mountain might be melted by the heat of sunlight and become flowing water to flow down to the bottom of the mountain, then gathered in a sunken place again."</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"No matter what kind of its form and the influencing temperature in any environment, even on the top of the high standing mountain, all of the water-particles could naturally gather together and connect with each other. I think it's so called '咸'."</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"In the ancient time, '咸' was similar to the other word '戌' which had a meaning about 'defense' and symbolically graphed from a kind of battle-ax. Except that, It had the other meaning of 'all the civilians are also soldiers'. That's why '咸' also meant 'all', 'total' or 'entirely', and so on....."</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"Yes! It just liked a group of birds gather in a tree, each one of them might detect each direction, and tightly communicate with each others by their singing sounds as an alert organization."</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"Why we can talk with each other easily?...... Because we understand each other's language, but somehow this qua was focused on the issue of more sensitive communication without talking."</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"Actually the electricity could be transmitted by the water, and the nervous system in human body also transmits the weak electrical signals which are carried and operated by the nervous transmitting materials. The sensitive transmitting ability is usually built by the water and weak alkali materials, this effect had been noted by some words in this qua."</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"That's why the original author of The I.E. Scripture also revealed: Sometimes the little babies frequently wet their thumbs by their weak alkali mouth water, because of when they grew up day by day, their skins started to become more dry, what they doing were just trying to communicate with their mothers through the air when their mothers were busy with other things and leaving them alone. That seemed like a basic example of the wireless electrical transmission in mind talking between the familiars, it's a sort of interactive telepathy."</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"Some other words in the second yao and third yao also revealed, actually every part of the muscles in the human body are communicated by the nervous system, and linking with each others to move or react, adjust and change themselves in time . If the natural reaction of a part was always suppressed, after a period of time, its sensitive ability might be reduced or turned off, even became disable."</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"Mind talking might be the normal abilities of our ancestors in ancient time, but I think we still aren’t losing all of it. Sometimes we might get the idea from the air and follow our institution to react, or move on the right way without exact reason could tell......"</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"Sure, if you were a skillful musician, all you had exercised, would let you act and play your instrument with ease. The sensitive ability might be built on constantly keeping in touch....... Then the inter-transmitting code among each others might be more clear and readable for working together."</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"Actually, when we looked and listened, there was a readable code system always existing between ourselves and what we saw and heard. If something cannot be identified by such code system, it will be ignored by our sensitive awareness."</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"That means...... actually we might be aware-less about a great lot of information in the real world. But sometimes what we were interesting with or desiring to might build more strong inter-transmitting power with our own minds, even the invisible spirits......"</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"For all I know, the message-exchangeable, frequency-harmony and genuine-sincere seemed like the awesome common sense in ancient spirits-talkers's minds for communicating with the spirits."</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"的確，「咸」有「兼、皆」的意思，就訊息而言就是「謙、諧」。「咸」的極至就是「成」，就是全部的感覺，不是只有一部份的感覺，就訊息而言就是「誠」。換句話說，「通䁱未知，誠意為先」似乎是古代致力於通靈的人士所俱備的基本常識，也就是盡可能收集感知那些和所要通靈的對象有關的所有訊息。"</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"I know! It's not an easy work! You must have ever watched a classic movie 'Some Where In Time', its script seemed like just talk about time traveling....... And seemed like your spirit go to the other time-space and interact with the other spirits via a mysterious sleeping dream........ But what about the sense of love?"</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"When you loved or eagerly liked someone, you might feel that stronger mind-power at an unexpected moment. Your detecting sensors of the sensitive nerves in your body might be just activating and focusing on what you were loving."</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"Some outer characters of your lover might be a part of yourselves hidden inner characters, that's why the sensitive nerves in your body were activated and your feelings were becoming mightily stronger, even couldn't stand to fall in a speedy passionate connection."</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"You might ask yourself: Why? Why I cannot help to love you so much? But there is not exact reason for explaining, just like some jokes just made you laugh loudly, but you cannot tell the exact reason why you laughed."</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"I know, sometimes a joke with the sense of humor might start to become boring after it had been analyzed and explained, or expressed by exaggerated gestures and expressions or sensational performances again and again,........so do the sense of feelings."</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"The sense of feelings might be built on imperceptible influence, it cannot be forced to make the sensitive connection immediately, and such connection might turn weak and loose after a period of time......"<br></div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left"><span style="font-weight: bold; ">感應現象在經過分析、解釋和演譯之後，可能會稀釋或淡化原有的效應、弱化原有的作用。此外，有些感應在某些狀況下是不能立即發生作用的，可能在長久的潛移默化之後纔會起作用。如果心靈相通的感應難以強求，那麼感情的維繫可能長久嗎？可能永恆嗎？<br></span></div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"Anyway,......don't you think there is forever passion in the world? ...... Or the endless love in the great universe?"</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"Due to the limited transmitting speed of light in very long distance, when we find a shining star in the night sky, it might have extinguished very long time ago, and we are just seeing its past existence and its history."</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"Sometimes love just like a warming and shining light could light up someone's life,......no matter if it's here or not, no matter  if it's just existing or already had gone......"</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"Maybe......to love a spirit is easier than to love a real person, the love between the spirits of angels seemed like the greatest forever love stories,......just like 牛郎與織女,......Cupido and Psyche,......梁山伯與祝英台,......Romeo and Juliet,....."</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"If you are a storyteller, you will not put Cupido and 織女 together in a love story, and will not bring 梁山伯 and Juliet together, too. Because of such random relationships are nonsense..........."</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"Yes!...... Cupido was not Cowherd, Weaving Maid was not Psyche, Romeo was not Liang Shan Bo, and Juliet was not Ju Ying Tai, though there were a few similar characters in their names........."</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"So, how will you think about the relationship between a human and a mermaid?....... Will it be forever?......."</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"Why forever?...... Why sometimes we liked to run for the forever things and didn't concern about the reality of our limited lives?"</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"That's why the next qua '恆' was going to talk about always keep in touch or endlessly concern and interact with the other....... That might be the long term sensibility related to forever........"</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"If someday we all lose our sensibilities, will we still keep in touch with each other?........."</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"I think......I'll try hard to remember you, only you,.......in every final quarter, every final qua, even every final second.......before I losing my mind,.......and forgetting your name,........forgetting all we had ever talked,........forgetting everything about you.......and about me.............."</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"Do you think you could control yourselves remembering?...... A lake on a mountain just like a small sea far away from the great sea. Small sea could exchange the messages with great sea via the cloud, rain and wind, or via the water and air...... That's just a sort of telepathic effect......., and actually your memory is not just yours, but connects with the great memory of the universe......."</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"We might lose our memory temporally, but not forever lose...... That's just temporally lose connections with the great memory, not lose the memory itself at all.........."</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"Memory is always there, it is chasing and influence us with the codes of ourselves sensibilities all the time,......if we don't keep going on the way of exploration, it might overtake our clear minds immediately........."</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"Why we need every sensor to collect all of the sensible messages? Because of we need correct our mistaken memories about everything,...... about the sea and ocean,...... about the mountain and sky........ That might be the unlimited work in our limited lives........"</div>
