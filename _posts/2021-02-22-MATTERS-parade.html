<h1><a href="https://allpoetry.com/poem/15715267-Parade-by-Simon-Cheng-Wai-Him" target="_blank">Parade</a></h1><p>When I was young,</p><p>we all, move</p><p>From here to there;</p><p>But all of us never</p><p>meet him</p><p>in photos, boxes, letters and cologne.</p><p>Move by cars to cars,</p><p>stretch east to west</p><p>miles of the sliver birch.</p><p><br></p><p>We growth</p><p>And pick out the cars,</p><p>In the middle of the night</p><p>The sparkle tore by the winds’ swish</p><p>We never have any chance to hear the admonition</p><p>by mother</p><p>Of the difference of dove and love</p><p>Abandoned and adores;</p><p>To grasp, the one with two sides</p><p>in life, since we were cast on the flesh.</p><p>On becoming a traveler,</p><p>from the genial bed to wrangle room</p><p>to the rear seat of my car, in cold-blooded.</p><p>The Parade scattered with shatter petals;</p><p>Into image of fading body;</p><p>Indeed, this is the reason of</p><p>He</p><p>always doesn’t to be seen.</p>
