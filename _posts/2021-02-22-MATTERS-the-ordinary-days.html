<h1><a href="https://allpoetry.com/poem/15713811-The-Ordinary-days-by-Simon-Cheng-Wai-Him" target="_blank">The Ordinary days</a></h1><p>For healing my aphasia,</p><p>I step aside</p><p>for my fellow joys.</p><p>After they hit me,</p><p>against the wall.</p><p><br></p><p>I beg to those little goddess of words</p><p>then I can be the one of their fellowship</p><p>The Deity, knows as the God of fate,</p><p>my loneliness</p><p>does not satisfying</p><p>He summons the solitude;</p><p>which is belongs to single mother,</p><p>exiles and the abandoned one.</p><p><br></p><p>The god of leaf, gecko and bricks</p><p>Sympathetic, with</p><p>Impairment speech whispering malice and spite.</p><p>But before the coma,</p><p>I glimpse the sky,</p><p>dyed fabric, which is the</p><p>figure form behind of her</p><p>Little goddess will speak the ode of fond,</p><p>ode to her, I believe.</p>
