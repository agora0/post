<p>February 24th this year marks the two-year anniversary of the full-scale war between Russia and Ukraine. Including the preceding "Donbas War" in Eastern Ukraine, the Russia-Ukraine conflict has been ongoing for nearly a decade, resulting in the deaths and disabilities of hundreds of thousands from both sides, including over a hundred thousand Ukrainian civilians wounded or killed, and millions becoming refugees.</p><p></p><p>Both Western and Asian countries, including North Korea, Iran, China, and India, have been involved in the war in various ways and degrees. The global economy, politics, military, and international relations have all been affected, mostly negatively. The Russia-Ukraine war can be considered the most globally impactful conflict since the Vietnam War, involving numerous countries.</p><p></p><p>Despite the prolonged conflict, there are still no signs of ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, the Israel-Palestine conflict (Israel-Gaza War), ongoing since last October, shows no real signs of peace. Although seemingly smaller in scale than the Russia-Ukraine war, Israel's military actions have resulted in 30,000 deaths and many more injuries in Gaza, with over a million Palestinians displaced and lacking medical supplies. The majority of these casualties are civilians. In terms of the severity and density of the humanitarian crisis, Gaza surpasses Ukraine, with widespread warfare, death, and grieving for lost relatives.</p><p></p><p>These wars have caused significant destruction to the involved countries and greatly disturbed regional and global order, exacerbating the already unstable international situation. The conflicts have not only torn apart Russia and Ukraine, Palestine and Israel, but also the East and West, Muslims and Jews, and the free world and authoritarian regimes, creating significant internal discord and rifts within the West and the free world. The heaviest toll has been on the people of Ukraine and Gaza, who are the most direct and severe victims, with many dead, disabled, or displaced.</p><p></p><p>The escalation of these wars was unnecessary and should be ended promptly. All involved parties, both directly and indirectly, should actively work towards achieving peace sooner.</p><p></p><p>Russia's invasion of Ukraine, driven by Putin's political ambition, power lust, and the encouragement of extreme nationalists and imperialists, represents an unjust war harming both Ukraine and Russia. This deserves strong condemnation from the international community. The Russian people should also actively oppose the war to prevent its continuation. Despite the Russian government's suppression of anti-war movements and the arrest of activists, more Russians should stand up in various ways to halt the ongoing conflict, rather than remaining silent or even supporting Putin's brutal aggression.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, countries including Ukraine should respect Russia's legitimate national interests and the opinions of pro-Russian communities and regions in Ukraine. While Crimea and the Donbas region legally belong to Ukraine, the fact that these areas have a majority of Russian and pro-Russian residents is undeniable. Respecting these regions' autonomy and not insisting on complete obedience to Kyiv's orders could weaken Putin's excuse for invading Ukraine and possibly lead to a faster peace agreement.</p><p></p><p>Recently, Russian forces captured the Ukrainian stronghold of Avdiivka, showing that despite significant losses, Russian military capabilities remain strong. Without direct NATO involvement, Ukrainian forces are unlikely to defeat Russia alone. The prolonged conflict primarily harms Ukraine's military and civilians.</p><p></p><p>Over two years, Ukraine has bravely resisted Russian advances but has suffered significant casualties. Zelensky mentioned 31,000 Ukrainian military deaths on the two-year anniversary, a figure likely underestimated. Civilian deaths are even more tragic, with the suffering of women and children being particularly grievous. Ukraine's economy has also collapsed due to the war.</p><p></p><p>Given these costs, Ukraine and its Western allies should prioritize achieving peace quickly over seeking justice (completely defeating Russian forces, punishing war criminals). Military actions should aim to compel Russia to seek peace, and territories in Eastern Ukraine occupied by Russia, if not quickly recoverable militarily, should be gradually reclaimed through peaceful means.</p><p></p><p>In July 2022, the author published "The Most Realistic Compromise Solution to End the Russia-Ukraine War" in the Taiwanese "Up Media," detailing the damage caused by the protracted war to both sides and calling for an early ceasefire. The author also wrote to the embassies of Russia and Ukraine, hoping for peace. Yet, after more than a year, the war continues, which is deeply distressing. However, the author still hopes for empathy from both sides and an early peace.</p><p></p><p>Another conflict that should come to a halt for peace is the Israel-Gaza War. Compared to the utterly unnecessary war between Russia and Ukraine, I deeply understand the long-standing grievances and profound hatred between Israel and Palestine. I sympathize with both sides, but my sympathy leans more towards the Palestinians, who are in a more vulnerable position and have suffered more.</p><p></p><p>The recent military actions by Israel were triggered by Hamas attacks on Israeli soldiers and civilians, leading to casualties. However, the root cause of Hamas's attacks lies in Israel's blockade of Gaza, encroachment on Palestinian living spaces, and many other forms of oppression and bullying. The existence of organizations like Hamas and their resort to terror is a consequence of the military imbalance. While Hamas's attacks on Israeli civilians are condemnable, the widespread and enduring suffering of the Palestinian people cannot be overlooked.</p><p></p><p>Even looking solely at the current conflict, the casualties among Palestinians due to Israeli retaliation far exceed those caused by Hamas to Israelis. Israel's military actions have also led to water and electricity cutoffs in Gaza, a shortage of medical supplies, and massive displacement of people, causing indirect harm that is substantial and hard to quantify. By the principle of "an eye for an eye," Israel has already exceeded necessary limits.</p><p></p><p>The Palestinian people cannot be eradicated; even if Israel occupies Gaza and kills most Hamas members, more Palestinians will join the armed resistance against Israel. This vicious cycle will continue, leaving both Palestinians and Israelis living and dying in pain and fear, and the Middle East will never have peace. This should not be the case. Humanity in the 21st century cannot continue to exist through killing, violent conquests, and ethnic cleansing as in ancient times; these are not the rules of a civilized society.</p><p></p><p>Both Israel and Palestine should cease violence, and Israel, being in a position of power and having caused more killings, should show greater restraint and goodwill. Only then is there a possibility for lasting peace and reconciliation between Israel and Palestine.</p><p></p><p>Regarding both the Russia-Ukraine war and the Israel-Palestine conflict, it's not just about the belligerents fighting; countries around the world are involved. Many participating countries, under the guise of "peace," are clearly biased towards one side or, even if unbiased, do not contribute to peace and might even exploit others' suffering for their gain. This should be condemned. Countries, especially major powers, should consider the interests and feelings of the direct victims of war more, promoting peace and justice over self-interest and disregard for human rights. While it's unrealistic to expect all countries to be "saints," they should at least seek a balance between protecting national interests and promoting humanitarian peace, avoiding the escalation and prolongation of conflicts.</p><p></p><p>Ending the Russia-Ukraine war and the Israel-Palestine conflict requires all parties involved to understand the importance of compromise and have the courage to make concessions. If people only care about their own feelings and disregard the interests of others, conflicts will never end. Emphasizing "justice" over "peace" without the capability to quickly achieve "just peace" will only lead to more tragedies and injustices. All sides of the conflict and other relevant parties should find ways to promote a ceasefire instead of clinging to narrow stances and interests.</p><p></p><p>Achieving peace is easier said than done, but every stakeholder, every country, and individual in the world should do their part to foster peace.</p><p></p><p>Before the end of World War II, countries like the USA, USSR, UK, France, and China began to establish the United Nations, hoping that through the UN and a series of international treaties, humanity would not repeat the bloody wars of history. Despite the world remaining turbulent with occasional wars, and the UN itself being somewhat controversial, the post-World War II era has been relatively the most peaceful. This didn't happen naturally but is the result of the efforts of many dedicated to peace.</p><p></p><p>The new generation, in a world where nationalist and populist forces are resurging, and the international order is constantly fragmenting and reorganizing, should look back at their predecessors' longing for peace and humanitarian efforts. They should strive to find innovative ways to end the scourge of war and return the world to a state of harmony and peace.</p>
