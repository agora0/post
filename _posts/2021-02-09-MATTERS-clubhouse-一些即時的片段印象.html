<p>Why are we so desirous of communication with other human beings?<br class="smart">Are we lonely? Or <em>do we crave connection that much</em> – what does that say about our real life then?<br></p><p>Being a luddite, I have little experience with different social media platforms, but in my limited experience, I’ve never seen any other social media where you get such <em>a palpable sense of being in the presence and immediacy of tens of thousands of people</em>.</p><p>It literally is like <strong>walking into a market square</strong>, of hobnobbing and rubbing shoulders with others.<br class="smart">The energy emitted from the collective mass is both <strong>thrilling & exhilarating</strong>; <strong>all-consuming & enervating.</strong><br></p><p>Things move at <strong>lightening’s speed</strong> on Clubhouse: <em>already I cannot recall what happened 12 hours ago</em>.<br class="smart">So much so that coming off Clubhouse, the rest of the world seems to be <strong>crawling at the speed of a snail.</strong><br class="smart"><br></p><p>No wonder so many of us are addicted, many have spent every waking minute on Clubhouse, and now we slept on it too – as evinced by the proliferation of "silent resting rooms.<em>"</em></p><p><br></p><hr><p><strong>Hyperreality</strong> – the immediacy of communicating with so many human beings is <u>so hyperreal that it becomes unreal</u>.</p><p>In reality – saved for those who work in retail, hospitality & call-centre - we may speak to <strong>10, 20 or 50 people </strong>at most in a 12-hour period.</p><p>Our forebears – from hunter-gatherers to village farmers – would have had a similar exposure.</p><p>Yet on Clubhouse, you can hear from <strong>no less than several hundreds distinct human voices</strong> within the same period.</p><p>A similar analogy may be that of <strong>4K TV/film</strong>, <strong>the image is sharper than what the human eyes can see</strong>, and the effect is a hyperreality that becomes unreal and unnatural.</p><p>I have difficulty going back to work today, it seems like <strong>my reality has been distorted</strong> by the hyperconnected world of Clubhouse</p><p> </p><hr><p>In the first event I hosted on Clubhouse yesterday, I had wanted to talk about <strong>friends vs. fans, influence vs. connection, broadcasting vs. conversation, finite vs. infinite</strong>…<br class="smart"></p><p>Being human, <u>incarnated in our flesh</u> and <u>bounded in time & space</u>, <strong>we are constrained</strong> in the number of people we can have actual conversations with. How many can count <strong>real friends in dozens</strong>, let alone triple digits?<br class="smart"></p><p>Yet our mind can <strong>dream of infinity</strong>; our spirit <strong>yearns for the</strong> <strong>transcendental.</strong></p><p>As we scroll from room to room, hearing the hubbubs of thousands, what is that evocative of?</p><p>Perhaps it is like the Wim Wenders film, <em>Wings of Desire</em>, we had momentarily become the hovering spirits in the film who can <strong>hear the unspoken desire, hope, fear & sorrow</strong> of the many faces we beheld.</p><p>And we are seized by <strong>a sudden impulse to reach out and touch every single one of those voices.</strong></p><p>(Unless you happened to walk into a room loaded with <strong>political landmine</strong>. Then it is not inconceivable that you were filled with impatience and frustration, desperately wanting to <strong>beat some senses</strong> into those ignorant blabbering voices - this holds true however your political persuasion fell)</p><p>Why, I had wanted to become part of that general pool of humanity.<br class="smart">Or have I been spent by all that <strong>incessant speechifying</strong>, be it eloquent or jagged, voluble or wavering?<br></p><hr><p><em>Are we in the same room? Are you listening to me?</em><br class="smart">I imagine you to be among the dozens of unfamiliar of profile pics.<br class="smart">Or perhaps I haven't met you yet<br><br></p><hr><p><em>Do androids dream of electric sheep?</em><br class="smart">Yesterday I fell asleep in one of the rooms, and everyone in the room dreamed the same dream.<br class="smart">When I woke up, I had difficulty putting my clothes on.<br class="smart">And I could not tell whether I had been awake or dreaming these last three days...<br><br><br></p>
