<p>第一期从共产主义产生的历史开始，分析其理念和输出革命的特点，阐述这种思潮为什么曾经能迷惑住一批人，又如何在二战之前植入过美国社会，造成哪些破坏，最终又经历什么样的转陈变化？从中还可以了解到苏联/俄罗斯的过去，增进对当下的俄乌战争的历史背景的理解。</p><figure class="embed-video"><div class="iframe-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TsRuGB2TqCk?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></iframe></div><figcaption><span></span></figcaption></figure><p>第二期，二战结束后，美苏快速进入冷战，红色恐怖、间谍活动把美国杜鲁门政府渗透成了筛子。包括美国最高机密的曼哈顿原子弹计划，都有三位间谍打入，拿到核心机密，这大大加快了苏联拥有原子弹的速度。</p><p>共产主义的间谍活动成功渗透美国财政部，最大手笔的行动包括扣住了美国援助蒋介石的军费，帮颠覆了他的政府。</p><p>1976年毛去世，中国貌似走向一条越来越开明之路，其实不断向美国派送间谍，窃取军事和经济情报。光是近些年被定罪的特务就多达几十人。CCP的“黄金蓝”战术，还捕获了一度曾是国会情报委员会成员的众议员艾瑞克·斯瓦勒这种民主党重点栽培对象。</p><p>而这一切，不过只是冰山一角。</p><figure class="embed-video"><div class="iframe-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gxl_SnHAz2g?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></iframe></div><figcaption><span></span></figcaption></figure><p>第三期，红色恐怖系列最后一集，如何从内部瓦解一个国家？这些不是最近才有的事情，而是颠覆一个社会的长征。这些势力采取的早期步骤是，做一些系列操作来破坏一个国家。一旦做到了这些，就可以进入危机的第二阶段。</p><p>我们需要了解情况的真相，希望那些明智的人们意识到，正在发生的事情是由颠覆分子推动的，我们要反击现在正在发生的所有疯狂行为。</p><figure class="embed-video"><div class="iframe-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hFYZ7kx3BDo?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></iframe></div><figcaption><span></span></figcaption></figure><p>主讲Tom Hafer先生，毕业于MIT，开发拦截火箭和无人机系统的专家；目前指导青少年机器人团队并多次获奖。</p><p><br></p><h3><strong>红色恐怖 The Red Scare</strong></h3><p>（以下为对应中英文文稿，分成三部分穿插排版。）</p><figure class="embed-video"><div class="iframe-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TsRuGB2TqCk?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></iframe></div><figcaption><span></span></figcaption></figure><p>新年快乐。 今天我们的好朋友Tom Hafer先生要为我们带来红色恐怖的故事。 Hafer先生，下午好。</p><p>刘博士，欢迎您结束圣诞假期回来。 今天我们就来说说红色恐怖。 它以前如何？ 它是真实的吗？它还在发生吗？</p><p>正如北方好女巫格琳达所说：“越早提出总是越好”。 什么是共产主义？ 共产主义是一种制度，在这种制度中，国家即国家拥有所有财产，经济由中央计划。 因此，它由高层专家委员会计划，然后通过普通民众下推。它基于德国哲学家卡尔·马克思和弗里德里希·恩格斯于1848年撰写的共产党宣言。</p><p>共产主义内部只有一个政党，其他政党都是非法的。党至高无上，它比任何其他事情都更重要，特别是比人口的个人权利更重要。在实践中，它已成为一种帝国形式的政府，一直在通过革命使每个其他国家皈依，它在意识形态和战争武器方面都在输出。</p><p>那么选择之一，除了共产主义你还能有什么？很久以前，封建主义是统治世界大部分地区的方式。那里的土地归贵族所有，但由农民（有时称为农奴）耕种，他们可能跟土地所有权捆绑一起。换句话说，如果土地被卖掉，他们也会随之被卖。买方必须将他们的大部分产品、农业、畜牧业等提供给土地所有者。</p><p>紧接着出现了重商主义，它有点像资本主义的早期形式，只是它假设全球财富是固定的。换句话说，它既不增加也不减少，国家或国家必须最大化他们的出口并最小化他们的进口，以最大化他们自己的货币供应。它还鼓励对原材料和劳动力的殖民主义和保护主义。这样您就可以支持自己的出口，而不支持从其他国家/地区进口的产品。</p><p>下面就是资本主义。资本主义假设，通过对大部分财产的私有制和个人创业，可以使整体经济进步最大化。 国家的职能是为国防提供运行经济和裁决个人权利的法律环境。</p><p>然后是社会主义，它是共产主义的小表亲。 其中国家拥有生产资料，但允许私有财产。</p><p>所以这些是大多数替代形式的政府，当然也有这些的混合体。</p><p>是的，与其他形式相比，资本主义绝对是保护私有财产和私人权利的最佳方式。 但是我们的年轻一代非常喜欢社会主义，甚至马克思主义。</p><p>我想我们会明白为什么。 在下一张幻灯片的背景下，它的一部分是可以理解的，我在这里谈论第一次红色恐慌，它基本上是从1918年布尔什维克接管俄罗斯到第二次世界大战开始。</p><p>这就是背后的历史，1918年之前没有共产主义国家，但在1918年6月，布尔什维克暗杀了沙皇尼古拉二世和他的全家。 事实上，美国远征军在1918年至1920年期间偶尔与布尔什维克作战。但布尔什维克获胜。</p><p>1922年，苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟成立，包括俄罗斯、乌克兰、白俄罗斯和一个名为外高加索的国家。 所以这些在理论上是独立的国家，但实际上是由莫斯科统治的。</p><p>到1928年，苏联的版图已扩大到包括格鲁吉亚、乌兹别克斯坦、亚美尼亚、阿塞拜疆、哈萨克斯坦、吉尔吉斯斯坦、摩尔多瓦、土库曼斯坦、塔吉克斯坦、拉脱维亚、立陶宛和爱沙尼亚。 所以这是一个覆盖欧洲和亚洲非常大面积的帝国。 1939年，希特勒和斯大林签署了俄德互不侵犯条约，这似乎保证了德国不会攻击俄罗斯，反之亦然。</p><p>然而，在1941年，希特勒却进攻了俄罗斯。因此，不寻常地，俄罗斯成为了所谓的西方列强的盟友。仅仅是因为我们在与共同的敌人作战。</p><p>那么在一战到二战期间的美国到底发生了什么导致了红色恐慌呢？为什么人们害怕正在发生的事情？</p><p>在 1919 年，第一次世界大战刚结束时，美国就出现了广泛的左翼动荡。各行各业甚至波士顿警察都发生了3,600多次罢工。他们在媒体上被描述为对美国社会的激进威胁。 同样在1919年，左翼分子策划了针对一些知名美国人的炸弹阴谋。邮寄的炸弹有36枚，其中8枚爆炸，两人死亡。1920年，华尔街遭到左翼分子的轰炸。这是更具破坏性的，38人死亡，141人受伤。</p><p>与此同时，在俄罗斯，被称为契卡（Cheka）的秘密警察组织成立，他们处决了数十万俄罗斯公民。不一定是因为他们犯了任何罪，仅仅因为他们是中产阶级的成员。俄罗斯希望消灭中产阶级，资产阶级。这是契卡负责人的话，“我们不是在与单个人作战，我们是在消灭资产阶级这个阶级。” 所以如果你是一个成功的俄罗斯人，你就是契卡的目标，你可能会被监禁或杀害。</p><p>呃，我的印象是那些左翼革命太血腥了。</p><p>那时我们没有互联网，人们对社会主义和共产主义背后的思想有些迷恋，因为他们还没有尝试过，共产主义在1919年以前还没有任何历史痕迹。人们不知道会发生什么，而且 资本主义也存在不公平之类的缺陷问题。特别是在1929年及之前，在世界某些地区，当大萧条开始时，许多人开始从根本上质疑资本主义。可以理解为什么会有巨大的贫困和绝望。绝望的人会相信像阿道夫希特勒和约瑟夫斯大林这样的领导人，他们说他们可以让事情变得更好。这就是为什么世界越来越转向极权主义，在某些情况下转向共产主义和社会主义。</p><p>是的，当人们面临危机时，他们想要改变，但这并不一定意味着社会带来的每一次改变都会让我们走向成功的未来。</p><p>事实证明是这样，但当时人们并不知道，所以有相当多的劳动者和知识分子，把希望寄托在了共产主义上。许多美国人，包括一些受过教育的美国人，都前往俄罗斯帮助革命和建设东西。 结果证明，他们中的人不仅希望幻灭了，而且在很多情况下实际上被监禁了。因为他们仍然相信个人自由和个人权利，而俄罗斯政府不相信。 </p><p>无论如何，在那段时间里，许多共产党在世界各国成立，几乎都是通过俄罗斯政府官员的直接领导帮助。并且形成了广泛的间谍网络，特别是在中国、美国、德国、英国和许多其他国家。 </p><p>红色恐慌减弱的唯一原因是，在1941年，俄罗斯突然成为我们公认的对抗德国的盟友。 斯大林在媒体上被描绘成“乔叔叔”。 但事实是，间谍和颠覆在这段时间加速了。我们只是没有谈论它，也不想知道它。 </p><p>那么，之后发生了什么？</p><p><br></p><p>Happy New Year. Today our good friend Mr. Tom Hafer is going to present us the stories of the red scale. Good afternoon Mr Hafer. </p><p>And Dr Liu, welcome back from your Christmas vacation. Today we're going to talk about the Red Scare. What was it? Was it real and is it still happening? </p><p>So as Glinda the Good Witch of the North remarks "it's always best to start at the beginning". What is communism? Communism is a system in which the state that is to say the nation, owns all the property and the economy is centrally planned. So it is planned by Committees of experts at the top, and then push down through the general population. </p><p>It's based on the manifesto of the Communist party, which was written by the German philosophers Karl Marx and Frederick Engels in 1848. </p><p>Within communism only one political party is allowed, no other parties are legal and the party is supreme. It is more important than any other thing specifically more important than the individual rights of the population. And in practice it has turned out to be an imperial form of government been on converting Every Other Nation through Revolution, which it exports both ideologically and in terms of weapons of war. </p><p>So one of the alternatives, what else can you have besides communism? Well, long ago feudalism was the philosophy that governed most of the world. There the land is owned by the aristocracy but is worked by The Peasants, sometimes called Serfs, who may be bound to the land. In other words, if the land is sold then they go with it. And who must provide much of their product, the agriculture, the animal husbandry, whatever to the owners of the land. </p><p>A bit after that came mercantilism, which is somewhat like an early form of capitalism, except that it assumes that Global wealth is static. In other words, that it doesn't increase or decrease, and that states or nations must maximize their imports and minimize their exports in order to maximize their own money supply. And it also encourages colonialism for raw materials and labor and protectionism. So that you favor your exports in disfavor imports from other nations. </p><p>There's capitalism. Capitalism assumes that overall economic progress is maximized through private ownership of most property, and through individual entrepreneurship. The functions of the state are to provide for the National Defense to provide the legal setting for running the economy, and for adjudicating the rights of individuals. </p><p>And then there's socialism, which is the small cousin of Communism. In which the state owns the means of production action but private property is allowed. </p><p>So those are most of the Alternative forms of government and of course there are hybrids of these. </p><p>Yeah, absolutely then Capitalism is the best way to protect a private property and the private rights compared to other form. But our young Generation are so fond of socialism, event Marxism.</p><p>I think we'll see why. Part of it is understandable in the context of this next slide, where I talk about the first Red Scare, which was essentially from 1918, when the Bolsheviks took over in Russia to the beginning of World War II. </p><p>So here's the history behind that, there were no communist countries prior to 1918, but in June of 1918, the Bolsheviks assassinated Czar Nicholas II and his entire family. And in fact, the American expeditionary Force sporadically fought against the Bolsheviks between 1918 and 1920. But the Bolsheviks won. </p><p>And in 1922 the Union of Soviet Socialist republics was formed, including Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and a nation called Transcaucasus. So these were theoretically independent nations, but in reality ruled from Moscow.</p><p>By 1928 the USSR had expanded to include Georgia, Uzbekistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan Moldava, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia. So it was an Empire that covered a very large area in Europe and Asia. And in 1939, the Russian German non-aggression pact was signed between Hitler and Stalin, which seemed to guarantee that Germany would not attack Russia and vice versa.</p><p>However, in 1941 Hitler did attack Russia, and so uh unusually Russia became an ally, so-called of the western Powers. Simply because we were fighting a common foe. </p><p>So what happened in the United States in the period between World War I and World War II to cause the Red Scare? Why were people fearful of what was going on? </p><p>Well in 1919, immediately after World War I, there was extensive leftist unrest in the U.S.. There were more than 3,600 strikes across a wide variety of Industries and even the Boston police. And they were portrayed in the press as radical threats to American society. Also in 1919, a bomb plot fostered by leftists was discovered against a number of prominent Americans. There were 36 bombs that were mailed, eight of which exploded and two people were killed. In 1920, Wall Street was bombed by leftists. This was much more devastating, 38 dead 141 injured. </p><p>Meanwhile in Russia, the secret police called the cheka had been formed, and they executed hundreds of thousands of Russian citizens. Not necessarily because they had committed any crimes, simply because they were members of the middle class. And Russia wish to extinguish the middle class, the bourgeoisie. Here's a quote from the head of the cheka, "We are not fighting against single individuals, we are Exterminating the bourgeoisie as a class." So if you are a successful Russian, you are a target of the Cheka, and you could be imprisoned or killed. </p><p>Well, uh an impression I got is those left revolutions were so bloody. </p><p>We didn't have the internet back then, and people were somewhat enamored of the idea behind socialism and communism, because they hadn't been tried yet there was no history in 1919. People didn't know what was going to happen, and certainly there were inequities in capitalism. And in particular in 1929 and prior to that, in some parts of the world, when the Great Depression started, many people questioned the fundamental benefits of capitalism. And you can understand why there was great poverty and Desperation. And desperate people will believe leaders like Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin, who say that they can make things better. And so that's why the world turned increasingly toward totalitarianism, and in some cases to Communism and socialism.</p><p>Yeah when people face a crisis, they wanted a change, but it's not necessarily means every change the society brought up leaded us to a successful future.</p><p>That turned out to be true, but people didn't know that at the time, and so there were quite a few both working people and also intellectuals, who thought that the promise of Communism seemed very great. And many Americans uh even educated Americans went over to Russia to help out with the Revolution and to build things. Many of them turned out to be not merely disillusioned, but in many cases actually imprisoned. Because they still believed in individual liberties and individual rights, and the Russian government did not. </p><p>In any case during that time, many communist parties were established in various Nations across the world, almost all directly under the direction of Russian government officials. And extensive spy networks were formed, particularly in China, in the United States, Germany, the UK, and many many other countries. And the only reason that the Red Scare abated was because, in 1941 Russia suddenly became our reported ally against Germany. And Stalin became portrayed in the press as Uncle Joe. But the fact is that, spying and subversion accelerated during this time. We just didn't talk about it and didn't want to know about it. So what happened after that? </p><p><br></p><p>第二期</p><figure class="embed-video"><div class="iframe-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gxl_SnHAz2g?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></iframe></div><figcaption><span></span></figcaption></figure><p>1945年第二次世界大战结束后，欧洲迅速建立了铁幕。 在波兰、东德捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、保加利亚和阿尔巴尼亚建立了附庸国，这些国家成为华沙条约的一部分，基本全由俄罗斯统治。南斯拉夫也是共产主义国家，是唯一不受俄罗斯统治的例外。</p><p>从1945年开始，俄罗斯与西方展开了激烈的竞争。 俄国占领奥地利，企图在希腊革命，在意大利和法国等许多欧亚国家也有很大影响。</p><p>1945 年，一位名叫伊丽莎白·本特利 (Elizabeth Bentley) 的人担心自己会被联邦调查局FBI抓获，作为间谍受审。她合作做污点证人，供出了150名俄罗斯间谍，其中35名在美国政府内部，包括三名间谍盗窃我们最高机密，制造原子弹的美国曼哈顿计划。这些间谍行为，使俄罗斯更快地获得了原子弹。</p><p>包括英国情报机构军情五处、军情六处，内部资深特工，他们的许多高层竟然是俄罗斯间谍，后来被称为剑桥五人组。 Silby McLean、Burgess blunt和 Karen Cross，都是英国情报部门的高级官员。</p><p>1948年，俄国封锁了西柏林。 西柏林是共产主义东德内部的一个岛屿，在1948年之前的很长一段时间里，俄罗斯允许东德将货物通过一条走廊供应给西柏林。但后来他们在 1948年切断了这条通道，导致西柏林唯一能获得食品药品的途径就是空运。因此，美国与西德联合实施了空运，飞机连续不断地进出机场，持续了大概一年的时间，直到苏联共产主义者最终发现，他们的封锁不会产生效果。最终他们重新开放了路线。</p><p>1949年俄罗斯爆炸了第一颗原子弹。 </p><p>同样在1949年，中国共产党在渗透美国财政部的特工的协助下，接管了中国。他们封锁了援助蒋介石军队的款项，帮助颠覆了他的政府。</p><p>就在同一年内，朝鲜战争开始了。 一场美国参加的大战，但是我们却几乎输了。</p><p>1950年，国务院高级雇员阿尔杰·希斯 (Alger Hiss) 因为俄罗斯从事间谍活动而被定罪。</p><p>1951年 Julius和Ethel Rosenberg因为俄罗斯从事间谍活动、提供雷达和核武器机密而被定罪。</p><p>1951年，莫顿·索贝尔 (Morton Sobel) 因从事帮助俄罗斯海军的间谍活动而被定罪。</p><p>1956年，俄罗斯残酷镇压匈牙利革命，从而搓破了“华约国家主权独立”的说法。</p><p>从1945年到1980年，事实证明，许多俄罗斯战时秘密信息都是用密码写成的，可以破解，而威诺娜抄本就是记录这些信息的项目的名称。 最终解码了其中一些信息。发现大约349名美国人，与苏联情报部门有秘密关系。这些人在美国国务院、财政部、CIA的前身战略服务办公室，甚至打入白宫内部。 鉴于这一切，对1950年代的人们害怕共产主义的影响还有什么疑问吗？</p><p>哇，非常惊人。一些有效的间谍活动……它们确实颠覆了历史。 他们改变了整个世界的进程。和平的民主力量与反民主和集权力量的对比。这就是为什么他们投入如此多的金钱和精力，来继续渗透自由世界。</p><p>嗯，你是对的。 所以今天的问题变成了当下，1991年至今。 我们还应该担心吗？ </p><p>1976 年，毛泽东去世，两年后，中国经济自由化并似乎向西方靠拢。看起来他们可能会成为一个和平的民主国家。</p><p>1991年苏联解体，俄罗斯共产主义结束。 一切都结束了。 我们不需要再担心了吗？ 不，熊没有改变本色，还是俄罗斯熊。</p><p>在同一时期，被判为俄罗斯从事间谍活动的有：Aldrich Ames、David Boone、Robert Hansen、George Prof imoff、Peter Rafael、dabinski debbins、Charles Nicholson、Ronald Pelton 和 Earl Pitts。</p><p>不是俄罗斯停止了间谍活动，而是他们的破坏活动换了形式。它包括选举干预、间谍软件、勒索和敲诈。旧克格勃的一名叛逃者说，现在，心理战活动占所有克格勃活动的 85%，而不是传统的间谍活动，后续机构FSB继续操作这些事。我们还知道，俄罗斯在2022年入侵了乌克兰，并威胁要发动核战争。所以担心依旧存在。</p><p>中国呢？中国变得更好了吗？事实证明，熊猫也是熊的本性，在同一时期也是如此。我都不会花时间把他们全部读出来，几十个为中国从事军事或者经济间谍活动的人被判刑。这些还只是被定罪的部分。绝大多数特工要么从未被发现，要么在被捕前逃跑，或者在某些情况下，FBI和CIA故意不起诉，因为不想泄露侦查手段。然后还有性引诱，这种事件发生过很多次，但最有名的是方方。她试图引诱一些美国政客，其中还包括国会议员埃里克斯·瓦尔威尔。</p><p>随着对社交媒体的渗透越来越多，间谍活动或更广泛的颠覆活动出现了新方向，包括暗封和靠算法刻意扩大某些误导内容。鉴于所有这些事情，对外国特工渗透社交媒体以破坏美国，还有什么疑问吗？</p><p>我认为毫无疑问。 你甚至不需要派人，你大概可以让人在中国，不费吹灰之力就可以监视美国的任何一个华裔美国人。 因为像微信和各种中文论坛，基本上中国政府可以很容易地操纵他们的五毛军来监视我们。</p><p>你还是需要两者。是的，你可以远程做很多很多事情，但对于有些事情，还是需要现场作案。这是有历史证明的。</p><p><br></p><p>After the second world war was over in 1945, very rapidly the Iron Curtain was established in Europe. Vassal states were established in Poland East Germany Czechoslovakia Hungary Romania Bulgaria and Albania, and these became part of the Warsaw Pact and were essentially ruled by Russia. </p><p>Yugoslavia was also communist, but was the one exception that was not actually ruled by Russia. From 1945 onward, there was a great competition between Russia and the West. Russia occupied Austria, attempted revolution in Greece, with highly influential in Italy and France and a number of other European and Asian countries. </p><p>In 1945 a lady named Elizabeth Bentley was in fear that she was going to be caught by the FBI, and tried as a spy. So she cooperated and began naming 150 Russian spies, 35 inside the U.S government, including three spies in the most secret project, that we had ever had. America's Manhattan Project, which built the atomic bomb. And those spies allowed Russia to acquire an atomic bomb much sooner than would otherwise have been possible and at the same time. </p><p>It turned out that there was extensive spying inside of the British intelligence agencies, MI5 MI6, many of their top people turned out to be Russian spies, and they became known as the Cambridge five. Silby McLean, Burgess blunt, and Karen Cross. All senior officials within British intelligence. </p><p>in 1948 Russia blockaded West Berlin. West Berlin was an island inside of communist East Germany, and for a long time before 1948, Russia allowed well East Germany allowed Transit of goods through a corridor to Supply West Berlin. But then they cut that off in 1948, and the only way that West Berlin could be supplied with food medicine things like that was by air. And so the United States in conjunction with Western Germany mounted an airlift, that had planes going in and out of temple of airport in a continuous stream, for the better part of a year, until finally the Communists decided that their blockade wasn't going to work. And they opened up the route again. </p><p>1949 Russia explodes its first atomic bomb. Also in 1949 the Communists take over China, with help with assistance from Agents inside the U.S treasury Department, who blockaded payments for Chiang kai-shek's Army, and helped to subvert his cause.</p><p>Just within the same calendar year, the Korean War began. A major war that involved the United States, and that we almost lost.</p><p>1950 Alger Hiss senior State Department employee convicted of spying for Russia. </p><p>1951 Julius and Ethel Rosenberg convicted of spying for Russia, providing radar and nuclear weapons Secrets. </p><p>1951 Morton Sobel convicted of spying for Russia naval ordinance.</p><p>1956 Russia brutally suppresses the Hungarian Revolution thus giving the lie to the notion that the Warsaw Pact nations were independent. </p><p>And 1945 through 1980, it turns out that many of the Russian wartime secret messages were written in a code, which could be broken, and the Winona transcripts were the name of the project that recorded those messages. And then eventually decoded some of them those messages, identified approximately 349 Americans, who they claim had a covert relation with Soviet intelligence. These people were in the state department, the treasury, the office of strategic Services which was the Forerunner of the CIA, and even inside the White House. So given all this is, it any wonder that people in the 1950s were scared of communist influence?</p><p>wow I'm quite surprised. I would say some of the effective spices... they really turned the history upside down. They changed the course of the whole world. I mean the ratio of the peaceful, the Democracy power versus the anti-democracy and more authorizing powers. And that's why they want to investigate so much money and energy to keep inspiring the Free World.</p><p>Well, you're right. so the question for today becomes, the present 1991 till now. Should we still be worried? In 1976, Mao died, and two years later, China liberalized its economy and turned toward the west. And it appeared that they might become a peaceful Democratic nation. </p><p>And in 1991 the USSR dissolves, Russian communism is ended. So is it all over with. Do we not need to worry anymore? Well the bear doesn't change his coat, the Russian bear.</p><p>During this same period, convicted of Espionage for the Russians: Aldrich Ames, David Boone, Robert Hansen, George Prof imoff, Peter Rafael, dabinski debbins, Charles Nicholson, Ronald Pelton, and Earl Pitts. </p><p>That doesn't sound like Russia has stopped spying, their sabotage took another form now. It includes election meddling, ransomware, blackmail, and extortion. A Defector from the old KGB says that, now rather than spying, psychological warfare activities account for 85 percent of all KGB and its follow on the FSB efforts. And of course we know that in 2022 Russia invaded Ukraine, and threatened nuclear warfare. So it appears that there is still something to worry about. </p><p>How about China? Has China turned out to be any better? Well it turns out that the panda is a bear, as well during this same period. I won't even read them all out, several dozen people have been convicted of military and economic Espionage on behalf of China. And these are simply the ones who've been convicted. The great majority of agents are either never detected, or they escape before they can be arrested, or in some cases are deliberately not prosecuted simply because the FBI and the CIA do not want to give away the means of detection. And then there's sexual seduction, this has gone on in many instances, but the most famous and well-known is Fang Fang, who seduced a number of American politicians, specifically including Congressman Eric Swalwell. </p><p>Well the interesting thing has been the new direction of spying or more broadly subversion with the increasing infiltration into social media, including things such as shadow banning and bot-based amplification of preferred positions. So given all these things, can there be any doubt that foreign agents have infiltrated social media with the purpose of undermining the United States?</p><p>I think there's no doubt. You even don't need to send people, you probably can let people set in China, to spy any Chinese America in the U.S without too much efforts. Because like a WeChat and um all kinds of Chinese forums, basically the Chinese government can easily manipulate their Wumao Army to spying us.</p><p>Well you need both. Yes you can do many many things remotely, but for some things you need boots on the ground, and there's a history to it. </p><p><br></p><p>第三期：</p><figure class="embed-video"><div class="iframe-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hFYZ7kx3BDo?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></iframe></div><figcaption><span></span></figcaption></figure><p>这不是最近才有的事情，这是颠覆一个社会的长征。 这些势力采取的早期步骤是，做一些事情来破坏一个国家，例如：</p><p>美化吸毒，最终使吸毒合法化。</p><p>种族分裂，破坏核心家庭价值观。</p><p>渗透新闻界、教育系统和政府。</p><p>让赌博合法化。</p><p>使穷人一直穷着，这是你们想要的，让他们总是生活在愤怒中。</p><p>教导不尊重教育、工作、法律和正常社会。</p><p>攻击资本主义，说社会的一切弊病都是资本主义和资本家造成的。</p><p>创造一个永久的非法外国人阶级，这些人本质上成了现代奴隶，因为他们找不到一份真正的工作，被迫在地下经济中谋生。</p><p>一旦你做到了这些，你就可以进入第二阶段。</p><p>现在你有媒体站在你这边，可以压制所有的意见，只留下你喜欢的叙述。</p><p>你可以支持分裂的或无能的候选人。</p><p>你可以付钱给不工作的人。</p><p>你可以以公平的名义压制个人成就和个人责任，换句话说，那些愿意努力工作、学习并取得成就的人，与那些不做这些努力的人相比，他们没有更多的机会找到一份好工作或进入一所好学校，这是不公平的。</p><p>对很久以前所做的事情的赔偿，即使那些当事人早已经不在世。</p><p>将政府资金用于非生产性项目，将教育系统用于灌输而非学习。</p><p>激怒你的对手做坏事，还不能因骚乱或攻击联邦财产或联邦代理人，而起诉任何人；直到针对的是你的对手时候，才用法律的最严酷定罪方式去起诉他们。 </p><p>最后，当你完成了所有这些事情后，你就可以看到人们到底有多容易上当受骗了。</p><p>使逆向合法化。易卜拉欣·肯尼迪说，“对过去歧视的唯一补救措施是当前的歧视，而对当前歧视的唯一补救措施是未来的歧视。” </p><p>看，如果你能让人们相信无法无天，不要起诉不支付地铁票价的人，即使他们明目张胆地这样做；不要起诉拆毁雕像的人，不要起诉使用非法毒品的人；封杀你政治对手的平台，如果可能的话让他们被解雇。</p><p>最后，信不信由你，麻省理工学院有一位教授说，“理性是男性统治的领域，因此我们需要拥抱非理性”。 这种话真的是来自麻省理工学院教授。</p><p>是的，所以如果所有这些事情听起来都很熟悉，请考虑一下谁在推广它们？ 他们为什么这样做？并考虑这些人是否值得您的支持。</p><p>非常好，非常好的介绍，谢谢。 我非常喜欢所有的事实。这么长的历史竟然能在这么短的时间内重温一遍，太神奇了。但最后的部分，确实给人很多焦虑。的确，我深感担忧的是，<strong>我们实际上处于第二阶段</strong>。 我的意思是您提到的所有事情，我们都可以找到现实生活中的确切例子。 您觉得我们能做些什么来应对这种严重的情况？</p><p>我们唯一能做的就是了解情况的真相，然后希望那些明智的人们意识到，正在发生的事情是由颠覆分子推动的，我们要反击现在正在发生的所有疯狂行为。</p><p>我希望你的听众中，会有人帮助团结起来，把疯狂的人赶出教育界；会订阅愿意发布全部真相的媒体资源，而不仅仅是真相的一部分；并且会支持这样的政治候选人，他们拥有温和立场，支持保障国家和所有美国人民成长、进步的政策，而不是为了获得50.1%的选票而简单地迎合选择性的群体。</p><p>是的，这是一个很好的计划，谢谢。</p><p><br></p><p>This isn't simply a recent thing, this is the Long March of subversion. And the early steps that these powers take is to do things to undermine a nation such as, </p><p>glamorizing drug use, and eventually making drug use legal stoking;</p><p>racial division, destroying the nuclear family; </p><p>Infiltrate the press, the education system, and the government;</p><p>Legalize gambling, keep the poor poor. That's how you want them. They become a source of dissatisfaction; </p><p>Teach disrespect for education, for working, for the law, and for normal society; </p><p>Attack capitalism, say that all the ills of society are due to capitalism and capitalists;</p><p>And create a permanent underclass of illegal aliens, people who are essentially modern day slaves. Because they can't get a real job, and are forced to work in underground economies.</p><p>Once you've accomplished that, you can go to stage two, in which now that you have the press on your side, and the media you can suppress all opinions, except your preferred narrative.</p><p>you can support candidates who are divisive or inept, you can pay people not to work, you can suppress individual achievement and personal responsibility in the name of equity. So in other words, people who are willing to work hard and study and achieve things, they have no more right to get a good job or a place in a good school, than someone who didn't do those things. That's inequitable. </p><p>Reparations for things done long ago, to people who are no longer alive.</p><p>Direct government funds to non-productive programs, use the education system for indoctrination rather than for learning; </p><p>Provoke your opponents into misdeeds, so don't prosecute anyone for rioting or attacking federal property or federal agents. Until if your opponents, and then prosecute them to the fullest extent of the law. </p><p>And then in the end, state when you have accomplished all of these things, you're ready to see how gullible people really are. </p><p>You legitimize reverse discrimination. Ibrahim Kennedy says, "The only remedy for past discrimination is current discrimination, and the only remedy for current discrimination is future discrimination." </p><p>See, if you can get people to believe that lawlessness, don't prosecute people who don't pay their subway fares, even though they do it blatantly. Don't prosecute people who tear down statues. Don't prosecute people who use illegal drugs. </p><p>Cancellation the platform your political opponents, and if possible get them fired from their jobs.</p><p>And even irrationality. In the end, believe it or not, there is a professor at MIT, who says that rationality is the province of male domination, therefore we need to embrace irrationality. This is a real professor at MIT. </p><p>Yeah, so if all of these things sound familiar, consider who promotes them? And why they do it? And consider whether these people deserve your support. </p><p>Very good, very nice presentation, thank you. And I pretty much enjoy all the facts. The long history. You can review it in such a short time, amazing. But I see that the final slides bring a lot of anxiety. Indeed I deeply worry that, we are actually in the Stage II. I mean all the things you mentioned, we can find exact examples in our real life. Do you think what can we do to to counter this kind of serious situation?</p><p>The only thing that we can do is to understand the situation for what it is, and then hopefully the number of sensible people, who realize that those things that are going on are being promoted by subversive elements, will band together. And we'll push back against all of the craziness that is taking place right now. </p><p>I'm hoping that your listeners are some of the people, who will help band together and push the crazy people out of education, will subscribe to media sources that are willing to publish the entire truth not just one side of the truth, and will support political candidates who will have moderate positions that support the growth and progress of the nation and of all of the people of America, not pandering simply to select groups in order to accomplish getting 50.1 percent of the vote. </p><p>Yeah, that's a good plan thank you.</p><p><br></p><p>【前文导读】</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/8zZ8FhyFBAw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>关于共和、民主、独裁、集权、无政府几大政府形式的最好科普</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://telegra.ph/%E5%86%B3%E6%88%98%E4%B8%AD%E9%80%94%E5%B2%9B-10-23" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>决战中途岛</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u72wpqWCiG4" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>跨越美國東西海岸線的旅行</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://telegra.ph/%E7%91%9E%E5%85%B8%E7%9A%84%E5%AE%BD%E6%9D%BE%E9%98%B2%E7%96%AB%E6%94%BF%E7%AD%96%E6%88%90%E5%8A%9F%E4%BA%86%E5%90%97-01-02" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>瑞典的宽松防疫政策成功了吗？</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/fj4_Ffmeln4" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>Milton Friedman-诺贝尔经济学奖得主关于自由、平等、贫富根源的经典解读</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://telegra.ph/%E5%8D%81%E5%B9%B4%E5%89%8D%E7%9A%84%E6%84%8F%E5%A4%A7%E5%88%A9%E4%B9%8B%E5%A4%8F-%E5%A8%81%E5%B0%BC%E6%96%AF-01-03" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>十年前的意大利之夏-威尼斯</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://telegra.ph/%E4%BB%96%E4%BB%AC%E6%98%AF%E5%A6%82%E4%BD%95%E5%A5%89%E6%97%A8%E6%B3%A1%E5%88%B6%E7%BE%8E%E5%9B%BD%E5%9B%BD%E9%98%B2%E9%83%A8%E5%88%B6%E9%80%A0Covid%E8%B0%8E%E8%A8%80%E7%9A%84-12-31" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>他们是如何奉旨泡制“美国国防部制造Covid”谎言的？</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://telegra.ph/%E6%9C%AC%E5%8F%AF%E8%83%BD%E6%94%B9%E5%8F%98%E5%A4%A7%E9%80%89%E7%BB%93%E6%9E%9C%E7%9A%84%E4%BA%8B%E4%BB%B6%E4%BA%A8%E7%89%B9%E6%8B%9C%E7%99%BB%E7%AC%94%E8%AE%B0%E6%9C%AC%E9%87%8C%E7%9A%84%E7%A7%98%E5%AF%86-01-02" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>本可能改变大选结果的事件：亨特·拜登笔记本里的秘密</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://telegra.ph/%E6%9B%BF%E5%A4%A9%E8%A1%8C%E9%81%93-The-Quest-for-Cosmic-Justice-09-25" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>THOMAS SOWELL 托马斯·索维尔：什么人爱“替天行道”？</strong></a></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>陌上在热心读者们的帮助下，志愿者们也一起打造了电报教育、旅游、经济、美食等各种实用群，欢迎参加。</p><p>运动旅游群👉 <a href="https://t.me/SportsTravel" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://t.me/SportsTravel</a></p><p>社区建设兼读者群👉 <a href="https://t.me/+KY6EeBC-aXYzNmMx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://t.me/+KY6EeBC-aXYzNmMx</a></p><p>教育生活群👉 <a href="https://t.me/+V5Eq3FRCHsWWj7pR" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://t.me/+V5Eq3FRCHsWWj7pR</a></p><p>经济股票群👉 <a href="https://t.me/+QjssrdJyFOI0N2Vh" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://t.me/+QjssrdJyFOI0N2Vh</a></p><p>美食快手群👉 <a href="https://t.me/+jhhEPbS-JqdiOTg5" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://t.me/+jhhEPbS-JqdiOTg5</a></p><p>家居杂务DIY群👉 <a href="https://t.me/+MIVZFTnPBEkwNWJh" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://t.me/+MIVZFTnPBEkwNWJh</a></p>
