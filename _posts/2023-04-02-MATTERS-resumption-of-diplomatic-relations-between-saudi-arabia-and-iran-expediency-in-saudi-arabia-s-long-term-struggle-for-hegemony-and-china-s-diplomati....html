<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resumption of diplomatic relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran: Expediency in Saudi Arabia’s long-term struggle for hegemony and China’s diplomatic attempt to break through</strong></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March 10, under the mediation of China, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the Islamic Republic of Iran signed a joint statement in Beijing, announcing the restoration of diplomatic relations, which caused a shock in the world's political circles and public opinion. This means that since Saudi Arabia and Iran broke off diplomatic relations in 2016 due to conflicts caused by sectarian conflicts, it has been seven years since the two highly antagonistic Middle Eastern powers have achieved a major détente.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why Saudi Arabia and Iran resumed diplomatic relations this time shocked public opinion. First, Saudi Arabia and Iran have been hostile for a long time. The sudden resumption of diplomatic relations now naturally surprised all parties; the second reason is that the statement on the resumption of diplomatic relations between Shah and Iraq was announced in China, and it was reached with the direct participation of the Chinese side. This has made people quite concerned and curious about China's role and role in the resumption of diplomatic relations between Saudi Arabia and Iraq, as well as the further deepening of China's influence in the Middle East.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, why did Saudi Arabia and Iran, who are in the same situation, suddenly announce the end of the severance of diplomatic relations and the restoration of diplomatic relations? Where will the relationship between the two countries go after the resumption of diplomatic relations between Shah and Iran? What impact will it have on the situation in the Middle East and international politics? What is China's role in the resumption of diplomatic relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran? What changes does this reflect in China's penetration and influence in the Middle East and the world?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Saudi Arabia and Iran are major powers in the Middle East. Regardless of population, land area, or political, economic, and military strength, they both rank among the top five in the Middle East. What's more, both are important energy powers. Saudi Arabia's oil production ranks first in the world and its natural gas reserves rank fourth in the world; Iran's oil and natural gas resources rank fourth and second respectively in the world. This means that the two countries not only have great influence in the Middle East, but also play a pivotal role in the world.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saudi Arabia and Iran are old enemies. The entanglement between the two has a long history and deep roots. The vast majority of Saudi nationals are Arabs, and 90% of the nationals are Sunnis of Islam. The Saudi royal family is also the guardian of the two holy places of Islam, Mecca and Medina. Saudi Arabia is one of the few absolute monarchy (absolute monarchy) countries in the world today. The country's domestic and foreign affairs are controlled by the royal family and serve the interests of the royal family.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main ethnic group in Iran is Persians (in addition to some Azerbaijanis, Kurds, and very few Arabs), and the vast majority of its citizens belong to the Shia sect of Islam. The Iranian clerical forces that control the Iranian regime are also loyal Shia believers. Different from the Saudi monarchy, Iran implements an Islamic republic and a dual system. The religious power and the democratically elected secular government together constitute Iran's regime structure.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Saudi Arabia and Iran have huge differences and even profound antagonisms in terms of ethnicity, religious belief (denominational affiliation), and political system. The conflict of interests between the two countries in reality has intensified this confrontation, making it more intense and difficult to reconcile.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the period of the Pahlavi Dynasty in Iran, because Saudi Arabia and Iran were both monarchies and allies of the United States, the relationship could still be maintained due to the collusion of the upper class. Since the Iranian Islamic Revolution in 1979, Iran's supreme spiritual leader Khomeini and his followers have advocated "exporting revolution", trying to overthrow the royal regimes of various Islamic countries including Saudi Arabia, and promote Shiites in various countries to rebel against Sunnis. And Saudi Arabia has also raised Wahhabism (that is, an extremist trend of thought among Sunnis), and also regards Shia as its deadly enemy.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, the relationship between Shah and Iraq deteriorated sharply, and a fierce game was launched in the Middle East. Relatively weak and isolated Iran, by fostering Shia forces and regimes in Iraq, Lebanon, Syria and other countries, and encouraging Shia forces in Bahrain, Yemen, and Saudi Arabia to fight against the Sunni-dominated regime, has created a "Shia New Moon” in an attempt to confront the Saudi-led Sunni forces. On the other hand, Saudi Arabia has joined hands with Sunni countries such as the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, and Turkey to encircle Iran and suppress Shia forces in various countries.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the Gulf War, Saddam Hussein regime in Iraq was also a staunch ally of Saudi Arabia. The Iran-Iraq War that took place from 1980 to 1988 was an ideological conflict and hegemony war in which Saddam, with the support of Saudi Arabia and other countries, competed with Khomeini’s Iran for regional hegemony and suppressed the rise of the Shiites.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later, the international situation changed, and Saddam's regime turned against Saudi Arabia, and was attacked twice by the United States, causing the Iraqi regime to change hands. But the rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran continues. From Iraq to Syria, from Lebanon to Yemen, Saudi Arabia is engaged in a long-term "proxy war" with Iran.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saudi Arabia and Iran have also sought support outside the region. During the Cold War, especially after the Fourth Middle East War and the Islamic Revolution in Iran, Saudi Arabia has gradually become a staunch ally of the United States and has continued to this day. The Saudi royal family is a profit-seeking political group. They have no firm beliefs, let alone political morality. All domestic and foreign affairs are for the eternal prosperity and prosperity of the royal family. The Saudi royal family is afraid of all revolutions that threaten its rule, such as communist revolution, Islamic revolution, and republican revolution, as well as related left-wing and liberal trends of thought.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, in the Islamic world full of anti-American thoughts, the Saudi royal family firmly stands on the side of the United States in exchange for the firm support of the United States. For the sake of Saudi oil and gas resources and geopolitical value, the United States has also given up political morality, regardless of Saudi dictatorship, suppression of freedom, and human rights violations, and strongly supports the Saudi royal regime.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Saudi royal family did not put all their wealth on the support of the United States. Since the U.S. government always faces criticism and pressure for supporting the Saudi royal family that violates human rights, it often reminds Saudi Arabia to carry out democratic reforms, which makes the Saudi royal family quite disturbed. Therefore, it strives to get closer to China, spares no expense to buy various weapons including China's "Dongfeng" intercontinental missile, and actively supports China on issues related to China and the CCP regime in exchange for China's diplomatic support and military guarantees. .</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chinese government certainly doesn't care about Saudi Arabia's human rights issues, and even favors Saudi Arabia because of its "compatibility". Regardless of the need for resources or geopolitical interests, China is extremely happy to see Saudi Arabia's closeness and treats it as an extremely important ally.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iran, on the other hand, has embarked on a long-term anti-American road since the Islamic Revolution. Khomeini proposed "No East, no West, only Islam". However, in the Islamic world, Iran, as an Islamic country dominated by Persians and Shia believers, is incompatible with other Islamic countries dominated by Sunnis. Therefore, Iran in the Khomeini era was not only opposed to the United States, but also had a cold relationship with the Soviet Union and China. It was also isolated in the Islamic world. Only a few Shiite countries in power, such as Syria, had close relations with it.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Khomeini's death, Iran gradually abandoned its policy of "exporting revolution" and confronting both the East and the West. However, the relationship between Iran and the United States is still very tense, and most European countries are also indifferent to Iran. Therefore, Iran is gradually moving closer to China and Russia. China and Russia have also extended an olive branch to Iran out of geopolitical and resource needs. So the two sides established a relatively friendly and cooperative relationship. But this kind of cooperation is not firm, it is only out of interests, and there is no close relationship based on the same ethnicity and religion. However, since China, Russia and Iran are both governed by non-democratic regimes, the common authoritarian attributes allow the rulers of the three countries to have some common language and interest demands.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to countries outside the region, how to treat Israel is also one of the manifestations of the game between Saudi Arabia and Iran using external forces. Since the Islamic Revolution, Iran has regarded Israel as its most sworn enemy and publicly vowed to wipe it off the face of the earth. In reality, Iran is also hostile to Israel everywhere and encourages other Islamic countries to besiege and sanction Israel. This is not only guided by the ideology advocated by Iran's clerical forces, but also has the realistic purpose of attracting support from Muslims from all over the world.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, from the perspective of practical interests, Iran's strong confrontation with Israel will do more harm than good. Although Israel's land area and population are far smaller than that of Iran, its national strength and military strength are very strong. On the contrary, it has an advantage in the conflict with Iran and caused great damage to Iran. Many Iranian scientists and military intelligence personnel were assassinated by Israel, and the nuclear power plant was attacked and paralyzed, all of which are examples. What's more, Israel has the support of the United States, while Iran is relatively isolated and helpless. Therefore, in the Iran-Israel conflict, Iran is the loser most of the time.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saudi Arabia is not. Although Saudi Arabia is not only an Islamic country, but also the source of Muhammad's fortune and the founding of the country, the Saudi royal family also regards itself as the "Guardian of the Holy Land" and the orthodox successor of Islam. But in reality, the Saudi royal family doesn't care about religious beliefs, nor is it interested in "destroying Israel". Although due to public beliefs and the views of the Muslim world, Saudi Arabia has not formally established diplomatic relations with Israel, and it often publicly condemns Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories. But in fact, the relationship between Saudi Arabia and Israel is relatively friendly, with close high-level exchanges between the two sides, vigorous economic exchanges, and frequent political and military interactions in secret.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, in the Saudi-Iran conflict, Israel is of course on the side of Saudi Arabia (although most of them support it secretly, it has long been an open secret). Israel's support is very important for Saudi Arabia to gain an advantage in the game with Iran.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a word, Saudi Arabia and Iran have cooperated vertically and horizontally, and are engaged in a long-term game inside and outside the Middle East. The typical performance in recent years is that the two sides have supported their own proxies in the Yemeni civil war, and bloody fights have been staged on the southern edge of the Arabian Peninsula. The "Islamic State", which is dominated by Sunni extremists, also has secret and indirect support from Saudi Arabia, and is attacking the pro-Iran Iraqi government. And Saudi Arabia has severely suppressed the Shiites in the country. The fuse that led to the severance of diplomatic relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran was the execution of a well-known Shia cleric, social activist Nimr and dozens of other Shiites by the Saudi government.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Trump administration came to power in 2017, it has implemented a "one-sided" pro-Saudi, pro-Israel and anti-Iran policy, which is a great encouragement to Saudi Arabia. It is against this background that Saudi Arabia has intensified its efforts to suppress the Shiites internally and attack Iran and pro-Iranian forces externally. Direct involvement in Yemen's civil war is a prominent performance. However, Iran, which has suffered from tearing up the Iran nuclear agreement and being sanctioned by the United States again, is in a state of internal and external difficulties, and is at a disadvantage in the confrontation with Saudi Arabia. In 2020, Soleimani, the commander-in-chief of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, was trapped and killed by the US military, which caused Iran to be greatly frustrated.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Iran is not to be outdone in the face of adversity, and it still fully supports the Shia forces in Iraq and Yemen, including supporting the Iraqi government forces and Shia militias, defeating the Iraqi branch of the "Islamic State" and regaining Mosul and other places under the domestic and foreign difficulties; The Houthi armed forces in Yemen have dealt a heavy blow to the Saudi invasion of Yemen. The army built by Saudi Arabia with a lot of money performed extremely poorly in the Yemen war. With absolute equipment advantages, it was difficult to defeat the Houthi armed forces, and even suffered defeats. As for supporting notorious organizations such as the "Islamic State", Saudi Arabia dare not do so openly. Therefore, Saudi Arabia has not succeeded in taking advantage of the advantages of "one-sided" support for Saudi Arabia under the leadership of Trump-led American conservatives, and Saudi Arabia's struggle for hegemony has reached a stalemate.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Biden administration came to power in 2021, it has changed the previous Trump administration's "one-sided" Middle East policy of supporting Saudi Arabia and Israel, and gradually returned to the balanced policy of the Obama era. Agreement, willingness to rebuild US-Iran relations. This is obviously not good news for Saudi Arabia. The Biden administration also refused to support the Saudi invasion of Yemen, and even took measures to sanction it.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under such circumstances, Saudi Arabia can no longer aggressively launch an offensive against Iran. There are also signs of instability in Saudi Arabia. Whether it is the power struggle and corruption of the royal family, the voices of the people for human rights and women's rights, and the lack of economic growth under the single oil industry, the Saudi royal regime is quite disturbed. Under such circumstances, at least for the time being, Saudi Arabia does not want to have excessive conflicts with Iran in order to create a peaceful external environment and concentrate on dealing with domestic issues.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iran also has similar needs. Since the Iran nuclear agreement was torn up by the Trump regime and sanctions were reintroduced, poverty, corruption, and violence in Iran have greatly intensified, and social conflicts have become more acute. The people were extremely dissatisfied with the clerical forces in power and the secular government's domestic and foreign affairs, and protested one after another.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, the Kurdish woman Amini was tortured to death for not complying with the "hijab order", which triggered a wave of large-scale protests and violent conflicts, resulting in hundreds of deaths and tens of thousands of arrests. This greatly shook the rule of Iran's clerical forces.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iran's grand plan to extend its sphere of influence and create a "Shia crescent" has also encountered many setbacks and triggered fierce conflicts with Saudi Arabia, Israel, Turkey and other countries. Even Iraq and Syria, which are in power by Shiites, and Hezbollah in Lebanon, which are also Shiites, are unwilling to completely obey Tehran, but try to make more independent decisions on internal affairs and foreign affairs. The U.S. attack on Iran during the Trump period also largely dampened Iran's ambition to dominate the Middle East.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Iran does not want to continue to fall into a zero-sum desperate struggle with Saudi Arabia, but hopes to get a respite and prioritize domestic turmoil and disputes with other Shia allies.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Saudi Arabia and Iran have the desire to reduce conflicts and ease relations. Against this background, the peace talks and resumption of diplomatic relations between the two countries are logical.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But why was the signing of the agreement in Beijing, China, rather than the traditional and more common signing in the United States or somewhere in Europe? Why is the Chinese government playing the role of mediator instead of Europe and the United States, which are more involved in the Middle East peace talks?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fundamentally speaking, it is an inevitability under China's growing international influence, and it is also one of the manifestations of China's deepening involvement in Middle East affairs. In recent decades, with the strengthening of China's national power and the deepening of China's participation in international affairs, it has participated in more and more diplomatic mediation and played an increasingly important role. In the past, China mostly played a relatively minor role in mediation, and only participated in some routine mediation under the leadership of Europe and the United States. But China is increasingly unwilling to be a "supporting role", trying to dominate the mediation power of some international disputes. The promotion of the resumption of diplomatic relations between Sha and Yi this time is a more prominent manifestation.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Middle East is rich in oil and natural gas resources, and its geostrategic position is important. Many powerful and influential countries are also worth fighting for. Therefore, China's investment in the Middle East has been increasing to strengthen cooperation with regional powers such as Saudi Arabia and Iran. It is of course in China's interests that Saudi Arabia and Iran, the two countries with the most abundant resources in the Middle East, shake hands and make peace, and cooperate with China to advance together.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But China's influence in the Middle East is still far less than that of the United States. The United States has played a leading role in Middle East affairs for a long time, and this point has not fundamentally changed so far. Then why is the Shai-Iraq reconciliation led by China, and it obviously left the United States (even without notifying the United States in advance)?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is largely because China, Saudi Arabia, and Iran are all non-democratic authoritarian regimes, and those in power in the three countries share some common values ​​and interests. For those in power in these three countries, they do not care about human rights issues in their own country and other countries. Not only do they not have to worry about the domestic human rights situation in the relevant countries in diplomacy, but they even "sympathize with each other" because they are all autocratic dictators, and hope to jointly resist The threat of "color revolutions" in the democratic world.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the United States mediates the dispute between Saudi Arabia and Iran, it will often involve criticism of the human rights issues of the two countries, and it will require the two countries to improve human rights while promoting peace talks. Needless to say for Iran, for Saudi Arabia, although it is an ally of the United States, every administration of the United States, especially the Democrats, will urge it to improve human rights when they are in power. For example, the Obama administration of the United States linked its support and assistance to Saudi Arabia's domestic and foreign affairs with human rights, requiring it to gradually realize democratization and focus on improving women's rights. During the Trump era, the United States once gave up paying attention to human rights in Saudi Arabia and allowed it to kill the well-known "Washington Post" journalist Khashoggi. However, since the Biden administration came to power, it has resumed its human rights pressure on Saudi Arabia and stopped supporting its invasion of Yemen. All these make the conservative and stubborn Saudi royal family dissatisfied. If the United States is sought to mediate Saudi-Iranian relations, the Saudi royal family will be more subject to the United States and will have to make concessions on human rights issues.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But China (accurately the CCP regime, but it is called "China" for convenience) has no human rights demands on Saudi Arabia. For China, Saudi Arabia is an extremely important partner, whether it is oil supply or issues related to Xinjiang, Hong Kong, Taiwan, etc. that have attracted the attention of the international community.On the topic, all need the full support of Saudi Arabia. As long as China's demands in these areas are met, China is very happy to help the Saudi royal family stabilize the internal political situation and improve the external environment.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Saudi Arabia is also happy to meet China's requirements, and has been fully supporting China on related issues over the years. Some people may wonder why Saudi Arabia, as a Muslim country, sided with China on the Xinjiang issue and supported the Chinese government's various actions to suppress Muslims, including setting up "re-education camps"?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason is very simple. The Saudi royal family does not care about the human rights of Chinese Muslims at all, and they do not have a sincere Islamic belief. While exporting Islamic extremist Wahhabi teachings to the world (including in Xinjiang a few years ago), it also refuses to be responsible for the proliferation of religious conflicts caused by the actions of countries around the world, and it does not care about the lives and health of other Muslims. Right to freedom.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, China and Saudi Arabia hit it off. Iran, on the other hand, has always had a relatively friendly relationship with China, and is naturally happy with China's mediation of Iran-Saudi relations. Although a month ago when Xi Jinping and the Chinese diplomatic delegation visited the UAE, they recognized the UAE's sovereignty claims over certain islands controlled by Iran, which aroused strong dissatisfaction in Iran. But in the face of continuous internal political resistance and external diplomatic and military difficulties, it finally chose to settle down and accept China's mediation of Saudi-Iranian relations.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only Saudi Arabia and Iran urgently need China's mediation, but China is also very eager to complete this "business". As mentioned earlier, China attaches great importance to resource-rich Saudi Arabia and Iran, and hopes to strengthen its penetration into the Middle East. Mediation between Saudi Arabia and Iraq is obviously beneficial to China.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly, in recent years, China has alsoIn the dilemma of serious setbacks in both domestic and foreign affairs, needs some achievements and breakthroughs. Whether it is the impact of long-term "zeroing" on the domestic economy and people's livelihood, or external conflicts with the United States, Europe, Japan, India and other countries due to national interests and ideologies, the "national rejuvenation" and "Chinese dream" claimed by Xi Jinping and the CCP drifting away from reality. The recent sharp warming of relations between Japan and South Korea has also made China feel a crisis.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, China hopes to make a comeback in diplomacy, "break through" from the siege of Western countries and surrounding enemies, and strive to establish an alliance of autocratic and authoritarian countries that can resist the forces of freedom and democracy. Saudi Arabia and Iran are obviously very suitable targets. Moreover, intervening in Saudi Arabia-Iraq relations and the situation in the Middle East by mediating international disputes is also in line with the "political correctness" of international peace. Not only will it not be widely criticized, but it will also win praise.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, China actively mediates the relationship between Saudi Arabia and Iran, and achieved great success, which is the inevitable result of course.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the reason why letsense of worlduntil suddenly,It is also because the three parties of China, Saudi Arabia and Iraq are all presentThe agreement was kept secret before it was made public, deliberately avoiding other countries, especially the United States and Europe, from knowing it in advance.None of the three countries wants the United States and Europe to intervene in order to facilitate theirsuch as internal repression and external confrontation with the free world, etc.It is inconvenient to state the purpose. And the reason why on March 10signed and declared, There is also the consideration of presenting a tribute to the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China and Chinese President Xi Jinping for his re-election as the third party and state leader. The previous secrecy was also to create a kind of gift surprise.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saudi Arabia and Iran resumed diplomatic relations, and China's diplomatic mediation succeeded. What impact will this have on Saudi Arabia, Iran, China, the situation in the Middle East, and world politics?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter for Saudi Arabia or Iran, easing the tension with each other will help them concentrate on domestic affairs. This also means that they will intensify their suppression of domestic resistance. Although they are enemies of each other, they have highly similar attitudes and goals in suppressing their own internal dissenting forces. Because China, not the United States, leads the mediation between the two countries, they don't have to worry about the mediator interfering in their domestic human rights issues, so they are more confident and bold in suppressing them.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the situation in the Middle East, Shay's reconciliation seems to be good news. But this settlement is temporary, limited, and expedient in nature, rather than permanent and fundamental. Due to the differences between the two parties in terms of ethnicity and sect, national interests and ideology, the possibility of complete reconciliation and peace cannot be seen in the short to medium term. And they will not give up their "cooperation" with their allies in the Middle East. The confrontation between the "Shiite Crescent" and the "Sunni Encirclement Network" will continue, but it will indeed cool down.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The positive impact of the resumption of diplomatic relations between Saudi Arabia and Iraq on other Middle Eastern countries is also quite limited. The easing of relations between the two countries is obviously not for peace in the Middle East but for their own interests. Therefore, they will not actively promote reconciliation and peace between countries other than the two countries or within countries, and the conflicts in the Middle East, especially the Palestinian-Israeli conflicts will continue. Therefore, the resumption of diplomatic relations between Shah and Iran will not be of great help to the turbulent Middle East.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the world situation, the impact of the resumption of diplomatic relations between Shah and Iraq itself is even more limited. But its other impact, which reflects the tendency of reconciliation and unity within authoritarian authoritarian countries such as China, Saudi Arabia, and Iran, to jointly fight against the liberal and democratic camp, is quite significant.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, the United States and the European Union countries have united with Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, India and other Asia-Pacific/Indo-Pacific countries and regions to establish a universal value alliance based on freedom and democracy, forming a siege against China. In Europe, European and American countries have also imposed a series of sanctions on Russia. After the outbreak of the Russo-Ukrainian War, a unified anti-Russian front was established to aid Ukraine. Needless to say, Iran in the Middle East has been isolated for a long time, and Saudi Arabia has also been criticized by Europe and the United States for its abominable human rights. Even though its resources are abundant,Nationals, especially the royal familyExtremely rich and still loathed by developed countries that respect democracy and human rights.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, these autocratic and authoritarian countries that wantonly violate human rights actively cooperate and hold together to keep warm. The cooperation between China, Russia and Iran has been going on for a long time, and the relationship between Saudi Arabia and China and Russia has always been good. The resumption of diplomatic relations between Shai and Yi today reflects further compromise and cooperation within the authoritarian state. They are also trying to bring more autocratic and authoritarian countries into the camp, cooperate internally to suppress domestic resistance forces, and unite externally to contend with the free and democratic camp. The combination of various dictatorships and autocratic forces is not only detrimental to the development of human rights and the realization of freedom and democracy in these countries, but also endangers the progress and prosperity of the entire world based on universal values ​​in the long run.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, in the short-to-medium term, the resumption of diplomatic relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran will indeed bring some relaxation and stability to the Middle East.accomplishThere is some hope for a lasting peace. Therefore, as far as the facts are concerned, we can welcome the resumption of diplomatic relations between Shah and Iran, and we should also appreciate China's contribution to the process of promoting the reconciliation between the two countries.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the long run, due to the profound estrangement and confrontation between Saudi Arabia and Iraq, as well as its authoritarian nature, contempt for human rights, and suppression of the people, this kind of reconciliation and peace is bound to be short-lived and unstable. In the negotiation of the resumption of diplomatic relations between the two countries, without the full participation and authorization of the people, there is only private handover between the ruling groups, which is also anti-democratic and lacks legitimacy. Expedient measures cannot lead to long-term stability. Sooner or later, the two countries will turn against each other again due to historical and practical reasons, and fall into high-level confrontation and conflict again. The proxy war will also reignite.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;China’s promotion of the resumption of diplomatic relations between the two countries is commendable, but in promoting the talks, it knew that the peace talks between the two countries were aimed at concentrating efforts to suppress domestic resistance, and did not mention human rights concerns, nor warned it not to suppress domestic dissidents. It also reflects the evil of China's foreign policy of ignoring human rights and the interests of vulnerable groups in handling international affairs, and focusing on pleasing the ruling classes of various countries, with the primary purpose of benefiting the CCP's own rule. The success of China's diplomatic "breakout" attempt will only benefitCCP ruling group, not conducive to China's national interests andChinapeople.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, the resumption of diplomatic relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran and China's mediation have eased the tension between the two countries in the short term and promoted the cause of peace in the Middle East. Shay's resumption of diplomatic relations casts a huge shadow, and even reflects the evil nature of autocratic and authoritarian forces colluding and helping each other.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Saudi Arabia and Iran, if they want to achieve real external peace and internal stability, they should carry out political and social reforms, promote democracy and the rule of law and social freedom, and protect human rights, especially the basic human rights and special rights of vulnerable groups such as women. . "The people are the foundation of the country, and the foundation of the country is stable." The improvement of human rights can lead to stability and peace.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for China, reforms are also needed to realize democracy and protect human rights. In terms of foreign policy, one should not seek only profit, let alone disregard universal values ​​for the benefit of one party, one faction or even one person. Instead, one should conduct diplomatic work based on the concept of humanity and democracy, and conduct frank dialogue and sincere cooperation with Europe, the United States and other countries in the world to promote political democracy, Economic prosperity,societyjustice, Regional peace.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
