<p>修訂對伴侶受養人 (dependent) 的關係條件作出改動。修訂前，伴侶受養人必須是 BNO 簽證主申請人的伴侶（即必須在申請當中）；而在更改條文後，就算主申請人已獲批 BNO 簽證（即申請完畢），其伴侶仍可被視為受養人申請人。</p>

<p>現時，BNO 主申請人的伴侶，必須與主申請人一同申請 BNO 簽證。文光解釋，修訂文件似乎說明，文件生效後，就算主申請人已獲批 BNO 簽證，其伴侶仍可申請簽證。</p>

<p>此外，文光指，現時 BNO 簽證伴侶受養人須與主申請人來自同一家庭，一般來說即共同居住，但修訂後，若雙方已婚，就算分開居住，受養人的身分亦可獲承認。文光指，修訂將容許已婚但未同居的配偶，以受養人身分申請 BNO 簽證。不過，申請人須在申請時提交證據，證明雙方關係真確。</p>

<p>不過以上只適用於「已婚」配偶。換句話說，若雙方是未婚伴侶，受養人仍須與申請人同居最少 2 年。</p>

<p><span style="display:none">&nbsp;</span>惟文光指，已婚配偶就算不須證明他們來英前同居，他們亦須要在到達英國後，有意同住生活。<span style="display:none">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>文光強調，修訂文件解讀僅供參考，有意申請者不應視為正式法律意見。</p>
