<p><br class="smart">On December 26th this year, the 130th anniversary of Mao Zedong's birth was commemorated across China. Various commemorative events took place, particularly in Mao's hometown of Hunan province, drawing large crowds and creating a fervent atmosphere.</p><p></p><p>Participants in these events had diverse motives, ranging from festive celebration to tourism, but some attended out of genuine admiration for Mao Zedong. Among them, certain individuals gathered to express strong ideological and politically motivated slogans, such as "Reject capitalism, embrace the socialist path; reject bureaucratic ownership, advocate true public ownership."</p><p></p><p>These varied motives collectively contributed to the enthusiastic atmosphere surrounding the 130th anniversary of Mao's birth. The Chinese government also marked the occasion with high-profile commemorations, including speeches by leaders and extensive media coverage, praising Mao Zedong. Despite being born 130 years ago and passing away almost 50 years ago, Mao continues to hold a significant place in the hearts of the Chinese people and influences contemporary Chinese society.</p><p></p><p>Since around 2016, discussions about Mao Zedong, his ideology, actions, and influence have intensified. However, in the past two years, there has been a noticeable increase in criticism and satire directed at Mao Zedong and the Maoist ideology, complicating public opinion. While online platforms do not provide space for anti-Mao activities, offline gatherings and parades related to Mao are dominated by individuals who worship him and claim to adhere to "Mao Zedong Thought."</p><p></p><p>In the past decade, China's political environment has become increasingly conservative, and the social atmosphere more oppressive. Previously influential liberal figures have been marginalized, and civic society has nearly disappeared. In this context, as expressions of liberal democracy are suppressed, some individuals turn to Mao Zedong, approved and praised by the authorities, shifting from liberal to Maoist beliefs.</p><p></p><p>In today's repressive environment and amid sharp social contradictions in China, people, through commemorating Mao Zedong, express their dissatisfaction with the current reality, which is understandable. However, viewing Maoist ideology as a panacea for contemporary issues is a serious misconception. I have discussed this in detail in a previous article, and I will not reiterate it here, focusing on previously unaddressed issues.</p><p></p><p>Some Chinese people's fervent worship of Mao Zedong, high praise for the Mao era, and complete acceptance of Maoist ideology reflect irrationality, extremism, severe knowledge deficits, and a misalignment with historical understanding. Many are unaware of the real history from the 1920s to the 1970s, forming distorted conclusions based on misleading information.</p><p></p><p>This irrationality and extremism manifest not only in the extreme rhetoric of Maoist individuals online but also in offline violence and threats. For instance, in 2017, Shandong scholar Deng Xiangchao was collectively attacked by Maoist individuals for criticizing Mao Zedong, leading to his forced early retirement. Maoist individuals also pressure authorities to arrest those criticizing Mao, even when such critiques are based on factual assessments. Such behavior is incompatible with a civilized and inclusive society that values freedom.</p><p></p><p>More worrisome is that Chinese Maoists, influenced by various factors, have become highly conservative and anti-intellectual, contrary to mainstream leftist forces internationally. Prominent Chinese Maoists, including Han Deqiang, Ai Yuejin, and Hou Ning, strongly oppose the liberation of women and sexual minorities, insulting feminists both domestic and foreign, and even advocating traditional gender roles.</p><p></p><p>Figures like Kong Qingdong and Sima Nan treat environmental issues, including climate change, as tools of U.S. suppression against China, portraying disasters caused by pollution and climate crises as products of U.S. "weather warfare."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Hongliang regards genetically modified technology and crops as Western biological weapons aimed at destroying the Chinese nation, rejecting scientifically proven benefits of genetically modified crops for agricultural productivity...</p><p></p><p>These statements reveal a conservative and anti-civilization nature under the guise of progressivism. The main Maoist media outlet, "Utopia," even praises far-right conservative figures like Trump. This alignment is both tragic and ironic. Leftists, socialists, and communists should ideally uphold basic principles of promoting liberation and aiding the disadvantaged, yet Chinese Maoists align with extreme right-wing forces, causing distress and anger.</p><p></p><p>Maoist individuals, in pursuit of their "utopian" ideals, have established collective enterprises and farms reminiscent of the old "People's Communes," such as Han Deqiang's "Zhengdao Farm." However, these supposedly egalitarian utopian communities inevitably become entangled in various scandals, including brainwashing, fraud, clear hierarchical structures, personal control, and sexual assault. This demonstrates that Maoist individuals cannot create an equal and harmonious utopia and instead harm many idealistic young people. The founders, often hypocrites, espouse noble slogans while engaging in despicable actions.</p><p></p><p>The idolization of Mao Zedong by Maoist individuals falls into a paradox. Left-wing revolutions aim to overthrow all "gods," including religious and secular authorities, to establish a classless communist society. Yet Maoist individuals regard Mao Zedong as a divine figure, treating his words and actions uncritically as absolute truths. They also oppose any criticism of Mao Zedong, even if it is based on factual and objective evaluations. Isn't this a betrayal of left-wing revolution and communism?</p><p></p><p>Maoist individuals refuse to acknowledge these simple principles and logic, reflecting their inconsistency in facing reality and logic. Such contradictions and a departure from basic left-wing principles are evident in Maoist individuals' words and actions. How can a political faction with such values be relied upon to bring positive changes to China?</p><p></p><p>The activism of Maoist individuals also highlights the absence of moderate progressive forces in China and the deteriorating public discourse and environment. If the use of Mao Zedong as a "god card" for activism is merely a response to the inability to express legitimate demands through universal values, that can be understood. However, if they genuinely deviate from the right path, Maoist individuals risk the recurrence of tragedies from the Mao era.</p><p></p><p>The legacy of Mao Zedong, his ideology, actions, and influence on China and the world, is complex and far-reaching, defying simplistic evaluations. Mao Zedong propelled revolutions in China and globally but also caused immense harm to the Chinese and other peoples. His spirit lingers, influencing present-day China and will continue to impact the country's future, manipulated by various factions. While not enthusiastic about this reality, I hope people facing the "Mao Zedong craze" can approach it rationally and calmly.</p><p></p><p>I especially want to convey a message to the young Maoist individuals who proudly hold up Mao Zedong's image and chant slogans from Mao's quotations. While retaining youthful enthusiasm, broaden your perspectives and think rationally. Whether supporting or opposing something, understand the comprehensive facts and analyze issues from multiple angles. Do not be misled by mere words and the confines of an "information cocoon." Always prioritize the well-being of the people over blind idolization and unthinking fervent support for any individual, regardless of their merits or faults.</p><p></p><p>Mao Zedong's birthday, coincidentally only a day apart from Jesus's birth, has been used by some Maoists as a basis for considering Mao Zedong as the "chosen one" for China and the East. The fervent worship of Mao Zedong by Maoist individuals is comparable to the devoutness of Christians to God. They seem to forget the line from the "Internationale" that states, "No savior from on high delivers."</p><p></p><p>When will the Chinese people break free from personal worship and anti-intellectualism? When will they stop blindly following one person and their ideas without discernment? Instead, based on facts and logic, independently think and adhere to universal values of humanity and democracy, resisting authoritarian rule and respecting diversity. Only then can the Chinese people escape from dictatorship and violence, ushering in individual liberation and national renewal.</p><p></p><p>The birth anniversary of Mao Zedong, occurring just a day apart from Jesus's birth, is a coincidence.
