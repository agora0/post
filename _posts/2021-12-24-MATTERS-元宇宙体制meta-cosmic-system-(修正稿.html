---元宇宙体制及终端Meta universe system and terminal
前言：久未上网发文，依老习惯一找到玩电脑上网新技巧就来转告网友。先向网友介绍近况，前几天去拿一年一度老人体检结果，主任医生当众大声说，终于看到七十多岁老人全部体检结果都在正常范围没一点毛病，问我如何保养的。我说，一是始终心情舒畅乐观向上多做善事，二是适度运动我每天去公园打羽毛球，三是注意饮食卫生，由我女儿严格把关。
言归正传:
 
元宇宙终端（草案）
---我一技巧用USB盘带你的电脑操作系统及工作程序和爱不释手的游戏等软件上班五秒钟即插即用
  ”USB移动硬盘安装Windows2019开机读盘五秒钟即可登陆系统“，其好处是：1，是目前元宇宙终端系统工具最佳选择，否则全球电脑SATA硬盘要改主机箱外热插拔，如今只有USB移动硬盘可行。2，装有你习惯使用的电脑操作系统及常用的工作程序和爱不释手的游戏软件，随身用一个手机般大的USB移动硬盘就可带上，即可在出差外出办事和上班用电脑时即插即拔（即上班电脑开机按F12选择进USB，来人不让泄密要退出就点重启电脑，黑屏瞬间拔去USB盘即登陆你正常工作系统）；3，比笨重的笔记本或平板电脑经济轻便可随身携带；4，不像笔记本或平板电脑外出需无线网密码登陆上网，常有不便，就是链接手机流量上网其信号强度和稳定也受环境位置影响，但USB移动硬盘可直接插本单位或他单位电脑或银行等机构自助机或网吧电脑的USB接口，即可用“以太网”无需密码登陆直接上网，速度快且稳定；5，由于使用的是自己的移动硬盘上的电脑操作系统，外出办事安全不泄密，不会留帐号密码在他人电脑里。
     技巧是先设法在USB移动固态硬盘上安装Windows操作系统，我装的是Windows2019，一次可能不成功要设法安装，如按F8用几种安全模式调试，我Windows2019装在“B”盘标签写“VCD”并选择“不显示驱动器号”可防公私间谍流氓软件常态搜寻等好处。刚装时初运行较慢，可用UltraDefragPortable 磁盘整理工具反反复复整理，然后用Windows 自带磁盘清理，但Windows优化项不对固态硬盘碎片整理认为意义不大；再经用 DiskGenius 分区软件选择去碎片文件分类复制，和GHOST克隆软件紧缩空间的复制；并适当优化选择系统"服务"关闭可不启动运行项，及删除公私间谍流氓软件， 最后我做到开机读盘五秒钟即可登陆系统。 晓鉐孜 2021.12.20
 
元宇宙体制
---人类终极体制
（可为《元宇宙联合国宪章》参考草案）
      实施元宇宙体制，人类应开启由"民主"走向"智主"，即崇尚智慧治理，由智者群体主导，逐步利用无人智慧体系辅助主导，也为现实世界开启人类的终极体制。 
       综合现实世界各政体和各国现实，绝大多数国家改革或变革选择了西方政体，但西方政体固有的越来越明显的缺陷已成为有人攻击、拒绝或怀疑的理由。这也使近年来西方国家出现了宽容那必将灭亡的独裁专制政府的左派当选，是不少选民失去信心和逆反心理的表现及原因。不仅如此，西方现政体的缺陷还有:  很难产生最佳决策，而大多是不优不劣成心对抗后的折衷方案，使施政不理想选民也易失去信心；财团商界巨头对政治影响过大；对立政党轮流执政决策易翻来覆去劳民伤财前后混乱，选民更易失去信心; 并不只是几人而是几党几大群体竟争最高权力，强对抗易使社会撕裂更易使选民大失所望；另外还有竞选的形象口才和资金作用偏重，不利于博才寡言的理论家和不利于无大财团资助的竞选人；大多数博才的却不善辩的竞选人易被仅仅是形象口才好的竞选人击败等等；西式政体在伊拉克之类的国家就完全失败，根本无法解决誓不两立的多党多教派的和平执政问题；还有俄国和美英法德等西方甚至世界各国政坛媒体最高端政客及左派，易被极左Antifa等极左组织全球总后台暗地收买，极左惯用的腐败这“灵丹妙药”不仅收买拉拢一批中国大陆高官，还长期不断收买拉拢大批各国高官。如联合国及其人权组织、WHO、美国两党和VOA等几任要员被收买，为腐败统治辩护或服务极为普遍。美国政坛被极左腐蚀收买，大有彻底颠覆美国体制之势。黑恶政党政治使黑暗丑恶事件一个接一个，都是为打击政敌和为其个人及政党利益，而丢弃原则不顾国家利益；选举年更易出现街头暴动打砸抢，可谓“文革“2.0国际版；全球政党政治腐败已崩溃，美国宪法危机铸成恶果之后，将掀起"元宇宙体制"热。
       因此西式政体并非利国利民的理想制度，西式政体势必改革完善，使注重发展中国国父孙中山五权分立的考试和监察更有必要。改革西式政体一切政党社团参政议政都不执政，中西结合优化五权分立(民)选(科)举智者治国。另外，美国无限泛滥混血的全国灰色人种化，结果显而易见，若干年后美国将没有白种人黄种人和黑种人，终将全是“灰色“杂交种。纯种人自寻消失，一国还可，他国不可推广，地球物种特别是人种的保护更为人类重中之重，旨为人类非灰一色的丰富多彩而圆满理想的未来，所以这一点也证明“美国模式”并非最佳榜样。
       为了人类和平，元宇宙体制应倡导：坚持“真、善、美”这人类至今最高最基本的“普世价值”；禁止包括炸弹、核弹、导弹、子弹和枪枝等一切爆炸性杀人武器。一切需要和平，一切基于科学，一切为了发展。 随文明和教育的发展，元宇宙体制以法治和德理相结合，法治的存在旨在维护公德，以公法与公德的治与理相结合，即法治与德理，治标与理本相结合；以民众与学者、民意与学理相结合，如公民直选与学者科举的选与举相结合；以东西方文明及各民族文化精华相结合，开创高速发展的元宇宙体制新世纪。人们普遍希望大变革应该和平过渡避免付出巨大社会成本和沉重代价，变革更要终止杀人流血。旨在也包括左翼的更多人欢迎和接受的,  不完全西化中西结合的，最佳选择必是实施元宇宙体制。
     中西结合优化五权分立真正落实考试权的高智商群体智者治国，一切政党社团参政议政都不执政不完全政党政治，也是否定全盘西化作世上唯一强有力论证，及优化改革完善甚至可谓挽救现西方政体的元宇宙体制。元宇宙体制实行士辅民主的“三府合政”制，其分权为手段合政为目的，其架构概述为：
1，改革孙中山先生提出的五权分立和西式三权分立为三府合政: （1）由新科举考试后全民大选出的“行政府”（可简称官府），其各机构和职能与西式三权分立之行政相似；（2）民选不需新科举考试的旨在立法的“议政府”（可简称民府），其各机构和职能与西式三权分立之议会相似；（3）新科举考试不需民选的具多重制衡权的“理政府”（可简称士府），理政府包括教育院、医疗院等生存权；文物院、私产院和资源院等资产权；科学院、（包括公德奖罚和智库的）德智院和考试院等考试权；检查院、廉政院和法院等司法权；传媒院、诚信院和监察院等监察权等的，组成松散结合的理政府，因此，理政府还具有小部分专业性极强的行政功能和部分西式议会参议院功能。
2，每届政府任期四年，行政府和议政府的大选为四年一届次，新科举考试为两年一次。参加科举的人必须是经体检、诚信和前科等资格审查的规定范围的名校博士获得者，参加科举考试不管是否中榜任职过，最多可容许三届科举中榜。新科举考试是主题为行政科管理学、政治科法学和经济学，加辅题即全部众多学科。新科举考试是超极限数量和范围之试题的考试，和才能智商检测（此项才能智商检测跟随高科技发展逐步推进深化）。
3，逐步引入精细化的公正而且高效的“投票份额”制，即选举公决和提案表决等一切重要公事投票表决的，历次累积的取决于对错结果并经电脑统计出的，每人每次投票的各自不同不断变化的“份额”，并记入诚信、资历和各资格等项。使所有人所有重要投票表决更认真谨慎，特别是更为有效。科举考试及大选、政迹统计、新政评估和投票份额等等要充分紧跟并利用不断飞速发展的技术的资源和作用，不断提高新政的管理水平。
4，行政府长官（兼军警最高统帅）由科举的两名排序最早的头名科举贤士申请参选长官者，为长官候选人，并在头名贤士中自主结合成两组竞选伙伴受长官级保护，再全民大选出正副长官，是两组就各政党社团的各政治议题的组合得出各自最佳的竞选纲领，交民投票选择。每次科举并大选上的长官最多可竞选连任一届；经二次和三次科举中榜并大选上可再连任。各正副部长级行政府官员由长官在对口各届科举考试合格的中榜贤士中任命，经另两府半数通过，可被辞但无再聘次数限制，其他官员由行政府长官任命。
5，行政府长官当选后辞去原社团党派教派之类职务，行政不带社团教派党派偏见，按需灵活择取各方各党各派争辩而出的非仅一方一党的全部最优决策，即无政党色彩无意识形态取向的各政党社团的各议题的组合出最佳政纲。
6，各党各派各社团身份或个人身份之参选者，经资格审查后均可角逐议政府议员，经选民选出不需科举考试，当选届次不限。其正副议长由议政府当届议员选出得票多者担任，议政府议员与另两府参加三府联席会议的人数相当。
7，理政府的正副理士、院长、考官、检查官和法官等要员由各届新科举考试合格人士即中榜贤士，根据其新科举考试主题分数和辅题对口学科分数排名，可参照原名校获得的博士专业或从事的工作专业分类入档，定期内三志愿对口投档按规定届序名次经电脑处理再公榜后上任。不需民选，也不由行政长官任命不对之负责，并行使仅不包括需“三府联席会议"裁决的一切各案裁决。每界理政府正副理士、院长、考官、检查官和法官等要员任期四年后卸职，重新科考中榜才可连任。卸职后留理政府还原为理政府贤士，可接受理政府或行政府其他职务任命。
8，立法提案三府均可经简单多数提出由各府参与审核，修宪、公决发起案、弹劾案、主席团成员请辞除名等特大案的终审裁决需至少两府表决通过提出，主席召集，须由“三府一团（主席团）联席会议"过三分之二表决通过；
9，主席团成员均为无权的资政，其中最新卸任行政府长官为主席，最新卸任副长官为副主席，正副主席任满后都与其余历届卸任正副长官、卸任正副议长和卸任正副理士为主席团终身资政，主席团行使礼仪特使、独立调查和参与特大案表决等职能。
10，元宇宙体制为民选和科举有分有合的“三式选举制”，既顺民意而又规范于学理,   既对比交织进而优化，也有利于博才寡言的理论家和灵话善辩的活动家及两者兼优人才都有发辉和贡献的机会。这体制的民选与科举不受年龄，姓别、地区、民族、党派、贫富、形象和口才等局限，公平合理，远强于现西式选举。
11，元宇宙体制为“士辅民主制”，在现实中至今为止所有民主，都是由那些强大的党派和利益集团主导的，元宇宙体制里经科举和民选脱颖而出之贤人贤士则是民意与学理的代表，而不是某政党、社团、教派或利益集团的代表。
12，各民族和各具特色地区有充分自治权，一个最小的群体最小的民族或最小地区只要出智者就有出长官、议长、理士等最大摡率，远比现西式选举摡率大得多，突显平等公正。
      党不执政与军不从政同理合理, 元宇宙体制易天下太平，避免现实中的社会撕裂和政变动乱。这中西结合不完全政党政治的，高智商群体智者治国的元宇宙体制，是人类真正进入新和平文明世纪的里程碑。元宇宙体制将导致人类的终极体制——从“民主”走向“智主”即崇尚智慧治理，由智者群体主导，逐步利用无人智慧体系辅助主导！

Meta cosmic system -- Human ultimate system  
(reference draft of the "Charter of the United Nations" for the meta universe)
    In the meta universe system, human beings should move from "democracy" to "intelligent leadership", that is, advocate intelligent governance led by intelligent groups, and gradually use unmanned intelligent system to assist leadership, which also opens the ultimate system of human beings for the real world.
      Based on the reality of various regimes and countries in the real world, the vast majority of countries choose the Western regime for reform or transformation, but the inherent and increasingly obvious defects of the Western regime have become the reason for some people to attack, reject or doubt. This has also led to the election of leftists who tolerate authoritarian and autocratic governments in western countries in recent years, which is the manifestation and reason of many voters' loss of confidence and rebellious psychology. Moreover, the defects of the western modern regime include: it is difficult to produce the best decision-making, and most of them are compromise schemes after intentional confrontation, which makes it easy for voters with poor governance to lose confidence; Consortia and business giants have too much influence on politics; The decision-making of opposing political parties in power in turn is easy to turn over and over, waste people and money, and the confusion before and after the election makes it easier for voters to lose confidence; Not just a few people, but several parties and groups compete for the highest power. Strong confrontation is easy to tear the society apart and disappoint the voters; In addition, the image, eloquence and financial role of the campaign are biased, which is not conducive to knowledgeable theorists and candidates without financial support from large consortia; Most talented but not eloquent candidates are easily defeated by candidates who are only good at image and eloquence, and so on; The western style regime has completely failed in countries such as Iraq and can not solve the problem of multi-party and multi sectarian peaceful governance; And a ready-made panacea, the most advanced politician and leftist of the political media in the West and even the rest of the world, is secretly bought by the ultra leftist organizations and the most common left-wing corruption. It not only buys and sells a number of Chinese mainland officials, but also buys and draws large numbers of top officials in the world for a long time. For example, several important officials such as the United Nations and its human rights organizations, who, two political parties in the United States and VOA have been bribed to defend or serve corrupt rule. The US political arena has been corrupted and bought by the extreme left, which has a great potential to completely subvert the US system. The black and evil party politics makes the dark and ugly events one after another, all for the purpose of attacking political enemies and for their personal and party interests, abandoning principles and ignoring national interests; The election year is more prone to street riots, smashing and looting, which can be described as the international version of "Cultural Revolution" 2.0; the politics dominated by global political parties has collapsed, and after the adverse consequences of the U.S. constitutional crisis, there will be a fever of "new deal in the meta universe".
    Therefore, the western system is not an ideal system that benefits the country and the people. The western system must be reformed and improved, which requires more attention to the development of the examination and supervision of the separation of five powers by Sun Yat Sen, the father of the country. Reform the western style system. All political parties and associations are not involved in the discussion of state affairs. The combination of China and the West has optimized the separation of five powers, universal suffrage, imperial examination and wise rule. In addition, the United States has an unlimited spread of mixed race national gray race. The result is obvious. In a few years, there will be no white, yellow and black people in the United States. Eventually, they will be "gray" hybrids. When pure people disappear, one country can still promote it, while other countries cannot promote it. Protecting species on the earth, especially human beings, is a top priority for mankind, aiming to create a colorful and perfect ideal future for mankind. Therefore, it also proves that the "American model" is not the best example
      For the sake of human peace, the meta universe system should advocate: adhering to "truth, goodness and beauty", the highest and most basic "universal value" of mankind so far; All explosive killing weapons, including bombs, nuclear bombs, missiles, bullets and guns, are prohibited. Everything needs peace, everything is based on science and everything is for development. With the development of civilization and education, the meta universe system combines the rule of law with morality and reason. The existence of the rule of law aims to maintain public morality, and combines the rule of law with morality and reason, that is, the rule of law and morality, and the treatment of symptoms and root causes; The combination of people and scholars, public opinion and academic theory, such as the combination of citizen direct election and scholar imperial examination; With the combination of eastern and Western civilizations and the essence of all ethnic cultures, the new century of the yuan universe system has been created. It is widely hoped that great changes should be made in a peaceful transition to avoid paying huge social costs and heavy costs, and that changes should stop bloodshed. The best choice is to implement the meta universe system, which is welcomed and accepted by more people on the left, incomplete westernization and the combination of China and the West.
       The combination of China and the West optimizes the separation of five powers, and the wise people with high intelligence who really implement the power of examination govern the country. All political parties and associations participate in the discussion of state affairs and are not in power. It is also the only powerful argument in the world to deny the overall westernization, and optimize the reform and improvement, which can even be described as the meta cosmic system to save the modern western regime. The yuan universe system implements the "three government co governance" system of scholar assisted democracy, with decentralization as the means and co governance as the purpose. Its structure is summarized as follows:
1， Reform the separation of five powers and the western style separation of three powers proposed by Dr. Sun Yat Sen into a "three government cooperation system": (1) the functions of the "executive government" (hereinafter referred to as the official government) elected by the people after the new imperial examination are similar to those of the Western style administration; (2) the functions of the "legislative government" (hereinafter referred to as the parliamentary government) elected by the people without the new imperial examination are similar to those of the western style parliament; (3) In the new imperial examination, the "academic government" (hereinafter referred to as the scholar government) with multiple checks and balances does not need to be elected by the people. The academic government includes the right to survival of education institutes and medical institutes; the property rights of cultural relics institutes, private property institutes and resource Institutes; the Academy of Sciences A loosely integrated academic government is formed by the examination power of the Moral Education Institute and the examination institute (including the reward and punishment of public morality and think tanks); the judicial power of the Inspection Institute, the clean government institute and the court; and the supervisory power of the media Institute, the integrity Institute and the Supervision Institute. Therefore, the academic government also has a small part of highly professional administrative functions and some Western-style parliamentary Senate functions.
2. The term of office of each government is four years, the general election of the executive government and the deliberative government is once every four years, and the new imperial examination is once every two years. Those who take part in the imperial examination must be doctoral candidates from famous universities within the specified scope of qualification examination such as physical examination, integrity and criminal record. They can take part in the imperial examination for up to three times regardless of whether they have served in the imperial examination. The subjects of the new imperial examination are administration, management, political science, law and economics, with auxiliary questions, that is, all many disciplines. The new imperial examination is an examination of questions exceeding the limit number and scope, and a talent IQ test (this talent IQ test is gradually deepened with the development of high technology).
3. Gradually introduce a refined, fair and efficient "voting share" system, that is, for all important business voting such as election referendum and proposal voting, the different and changing "shares" of each person's vote each time, which depend on the right and wrong results and are counted by the computer, and are recorded in the items of integrity and qualifications. Make all important votes more careful and cautious, especially more effective. The imperial examination, general election, political performance statistics, new deal evaluation and voting share should fully follow and make use of the resources and role of the rapidly developing technology to continuously improve the management level of the new deal. The final transformation to the whole society management depends on the unmanned intelligence system, that is, mankind is bound to move from democracy to the dominance of the wise, and from the dominance of the wise group to the dominance of the unmanned intelligence system.
4， Chief executive of the executive government“ (also the supreme commander of the military and police) the two earliest candidates who won the first place in the imperial examination and applied for the election of chief executive are candidates for chief executive. They are independently combined into two groups of running partners in the first place in the imperial examination. They are protected by the chief executive level, and then the chief and deputy chief executive are elected by the national election. The two groups draw their own best election platform on the combination of political issues of various political parties and associations and submit it to the people's vote for selection. The chief executive can compete at most Re elected for one term; After winning the list in the second and third imperial examinations, he can be re elected in the general election. The principal and Deputy government officials at lower levels shall be appointed by the chief executive from among the people who have passed the imperial examination at each session and passed through the procedures. They can be dismissed, but there is no limit on the number of re appointments. Other officials are appointed by the chief executive of the bank.
5. After the chief executive is elected, he resigns from the posts of the original associations, parties and sects. The administration does not have the prejudice of associations and sects, and flexibly selects all the best decisions of not only one party and one party debated by all parties and sects as needed, that is, the combination of various topics of political parties and associations without party color and ideological orientation to form the best political platform.
6. Candidates from all parties, factions, associations or individuals can run for "members of parliament" after qualification verification. After being elected by voters, there is no need for imperial examination, and there is no limit on the number of elections. The "speaker" and the "deputy speaker" are elected by the members of the current session of the parliamentary government, and the number of members participating in the "joint meeting" is equivalent to that of other organizations.
7， Academic government "gentleman" ", presidents, examiners, prosecutors, judges and other dignitaries shall be ranked by those who have passed the new imperial examination, i.e. the elites on the list. They can be classified into files according to the subject scores and auxiliary subject scores of the new imperial examination, and can be volunteered to file in accordance with the doctoral majors obtained by the original famous universities or the work majors they are engaged in. They can take office after the ranking is processed by the computer according to the specified order. There is no need for the people The election is not appointed by the chief executive, and it does not include all the decisions of various cases that need to be decided by the "joint meeting". The important members of the academic government in each field leave their posts after a term of office of four years. They can only be re elected after re ranking in the imperial examination. After leaving their posts, they can return to academic government sages and accept other appointments.
8. Legislative proposals can be put forward by a simple majority of all governments, which will participate in the review. The final ruling on major cases such as constitutional amendment, referendum initiation, impeachment and resignation and delisting of presidium members shall be put forward by at least two governments, presided over by the chairman, and passed by two-thirds of the "joint meeting";
9. The members of the presidium are senior officials without power. The chairman is the recently retired chief executive and the vice chairman is the recently retired deputy chief executive. After the term of office expires, the chairman and vice chairmen of the Presidium and other outgoing "officials", the outgoing "speaker" and the outgoing "gentleman" are senior officials of the presidium for life. The Bureau exercises the functions of ceremonial Messenger, independent investigation and voting on extraordinary cases.
10. The yuan universe system is a "three type election system" with the separation and combination of popular election and imperial examination. It is not only in line with public opinion but also standardized in academic theory. It is not only compared and intertwined for optimization, but also conducive to the opportunities for talented theorists and eloquent activists and both excellent talents to make brilliance and contributions. The popular election and imperial examination of this system are not limited by age, surname, region, nationality, party, wealth, image and eloquence. They are fair and reasonable, which is much stronger than the modern Western election.
11. The yuan universe system is "scholar assisted democracy". In reality, so far, democracy is dominated by those powerful parties and interest groups. The sages who stand out through the imperial examination and popular election in the yuan universe system are the representatives of public opinion and theory, not the representatives of a political party, Association, sect or interest group. Thus, from the leading of the wise group to the leading of the unmanned intelligent system.
12. All ethnic groups and regions with their own characteristics have full autonomy. As long as there are wise people in the smallest ethnic group or region, there is the greatest chance of producing officers, speakers of Parliament and politicians, which is much more likely than the current Western-style election, highlighting equality and justice.
It is reasonable for the party not to be in power and the army not to be in politics. The yuan universe system is easy for peace in the world, so as to avoid social tear and coup turmoil in reality. This meta cosmic system of incomplete party politics with the integration of China and the West and the rule of wise people with high IQ is a milestone for mankind to truly enter the new century of peace and civilization. The meta universe system will lead to the ultimate system of mankind - from "democracy" to "wise man leading" and finally to unmanned wisdom system leading!
