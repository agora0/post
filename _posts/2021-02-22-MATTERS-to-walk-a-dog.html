<h1><a href="https://allpoetry.com/poem/15715365-To-walk-a-dog-by-Simon-Cheng-Wai-Him" target="_blank">To walk a dog</a></h1><p>I can’t even explain what I’m feeling.</p><p>This is the way I talk about this.</p><p>The snow pressing on the rooftop</p><p>When her message came.</p><p>It was howling and</p><p>howled the sorrow, despondent dog</p><p>The level gaze of it</p><p>Betokened the indifference of the context</p><p>Of the unspeakable phone.</p><p>It might say anything about Mother</p><p>She is getting bad recently</p><p>Or the news of virus spends to another nursing home</p><p>One other</p><p>And other, another</p><p>to mom’s</p><p>Suddenly I even miss my day</p><p>As I am a child,</p><p>I witness the first day of my mother and</p><p>the Stepfather</p><p>They were intercourse and</p><p>vigorously hit me</p><p>As naked apes did the same</p><p>grappling</p><p>for their territory</p><p>I want to leave the goddanm room</p><p>And trample the nasty weeding dress</p><p>After all, she wore the dress for three times.</p><p>The last time she dresses,</p><p>She intent to kill herself.</p><p>Yet, she dressed it</p><p>In other to have sex with him.</p><p>I design to walk my dog</p><p>In other to forget this little story</p><p>As well as the disgusting feeling</p><p>Speak to</p><p>the shrink I have borrowed.</p>
