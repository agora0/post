<div class="draft--imgNormal draft-block"><img src="https://images.vocus.cc/b9cf760a-76e9-41fb-9e25-38675037ed65.jpg"><figcaption class="imageCaption draft-block" style="cursor:text;display:block"></figcaption></div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left"><span style="font-weight: bold; ">亨，小利貞。-- </span>如同觀察月亮光影區域內的變化一般，興致高昂的針對一個特定目標、漸次縮小圍繞目標的特定範圍、進行專注於目標的偵測和搜索，這就是所謂的追逐。反過來說，逃避被追逐或圍困的處境，往往也必需從一個小範圍中對外偵察與突圍。</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left"><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; ">初六：遯尾，厲，勿用有攸往。</span>/<span style="font-weight: bold; "> 變卦天火同人 --</span> 不論是追逐還是逃跑，在沒有目標或不知路況的情況下，尾隨他人行動往往是危險的，最好不要太大意啊！例如：駕車在後方尾隨他人行動時，最好保持適當的緩衝距離、以測安全，免得在高速進行時，當前方遇到緊急狀況、突然煞車或急轉彎，後方因為措手不及而不得不跟著做出「甩尾」(drift) 的高難度危險動作。尾隨他人的行動，最好事先知道目的，或是一起規劃行程，就算是在暗夜中迷了路，還能觀天文而知去向、依據日月星光來導向。</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left"><span style="font-weight: bold; ">六二：執之用黃牛之革，莫之勝說。</span>/<span style="font-weight: bold; "> 變卦天風姤 -- </span>如同優質的黃牛皮革也會變色、發霉一樣，就算執著追尋的是再堅固的感情、緊握追求的是再穩固的關係，仍然有變質的可能。感情的維繫是日積月壘、彼此心照不宣的事，嘴上說說還不如實際行動來的可靠啊！就算是付諸實際行動，也需要彼此善解風情。</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left"><span style="font-weight: bold; ">九三：係遯，有疾，厲，畜臣妾吉。</span>/<span style="font-weight: bold; "> 變卦天地否 -- </span>心繫追逐的目標，或是一心想要逃避追逐而不得，結果慌張失措、腳步混亂，甚至急出病來，這樣是很危險的。此時不如壘積相關資訊、設置瞭朢觀測器和訊息接收站，建立相關於追蹤目標或突破包圍的資訊聯結網，同時盡可能了解所處環境的整體狀況，然後決定是否展開實際行動。<span style="font-weight: bold; ">[P.S. 根據古代象形字可能的其它意像，此處「臣」解為「瞭朢觀測器」或「雷達望遠鏡」、「妾」解為「訊息接收站」或「電波偵訊座」。「臣」字在古代和「目」字類似，可能俱備某種偵察朢遠能力的特質，也可能與所謂的「千里眼」、「順風耳」有關，應該是君子 (journalist and prophet, or judge) 工作時的良伴。]</span></div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left"><span style="font-weight: bold; ">九四：好遯，君子吉，小人否。</span>/<span style="font-weight: bold; "> 變卦風山漸 -- </span>跟隨流行的風尚、探索奇異的現象、追逐美好的事物、避開困窘的處境，君子們通常不落人後、感到歡喜和樂意，但是少數人剛開始往往不太確定、甚至否定，直到觀望了一陣子纔逐漸投入。</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left"><span style="font-weight: bold; ">九五：嘉遯，貞吉。</span>/<span style="font-weight: bold; "> 變卦火山旅 -- </span>追逐受到嘉獎肯定的獎勵，通常被認為是值得喜悅的事情，有些人甚至為了參加遠方的獎項而組織團隊前往，展開長距離的奪標之旅。有時候，爲了躲避不斷累積的困窘所帶來的壓力，到遠地旅行也能增廣見聞、大開眼界、轉換焦慮的心情啊！</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left"><span style="font-weight: bold; ">上九：肥遯，無，不利。</span>/<span style="font-weight: bold; "> 變卦澤山咸 --</span> 當追逐的趨向抵達超凡脫俗的最高絕境之時，許多人往往轉而追逐虛無飄渺、捉摸不定與荒誕空幻的境界，無能為力於實質的利益。在這樣的情況下，追逐和逃避又有什麼不同呢？此時內心真正期待的，或許是心電感應的加強和超常能力的實現吧！<span style="font-weight: bold; ">(P.S. 此處「肥遯」可能與 English 中的 phantom 及 fantasy 直接相關，也很有可能是音近「荒唐」或「荒誕」的同義詞。)</span></div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left"></div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"It's no doubt that this qua was an awesome turning point in The I.E. Scripture, because of not only it was the start point of the third quarter in The I.E. Scripture, but also its title '遯' seemed like directly mark an obvious feature about turning....... 似乎是一個大轉變、大轉換的時刻......"</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"111-100, Sky-Mountain,........ Was it very tall? Such mountain might let us feel, if we can climb up its ridge and pass over it, then we will turn ourselves into a very different realm and circumstance."</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"Actually, there were a series of mountains called Sky Mountain or Teng'ri Tagh neared to Western China in ancient time, but I think the Sky-Mountain of 111-100 in The I.E. Scripture might be talking about the highest realm of mind, not the tallest mountain in reality."</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"The lyrics in first yao seemed like talk about a severely dangerous situation related to 'turn tail' or 'follow behind'. Why they escaped or ran after? What they hid from or chased for? How they fled or seek?........ These must be the major riddles in this qua."</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"It was obviously showing an awesome situation: They seemed like no more could stay at the previous place, and started trying to migrate and move speedily. The major point was what they feared and worried about, or what was the chased aim or next goal which they were going to run after? At that time, something must be turned on or turned off........"</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"Did you have the experience of just going to run and run without any exact purpose when you saw some people were suddenly running through your sight?......"</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"Maybe! At that moment, you might think some kind of crisis or interesting event was just happening and couldn't stand to follow behind the runners......"</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"Actually, such behavior is a little adventurous, because of you might not be able to make the well reaction in time as the preceding running direction is suddenly changed, then you might have to do a dangerous drifting movement at that emergent turning moment."</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"I think the better following method is trying to make a confirmed appointment about the running route and make sure where is the aimed place before the action of the group running."</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"So, to collect relative messages about the running way seemed like very important in the actions of escaping or chasing. The third yao even had noted that the ancient runners already took advantage of the radar and receiver to build the messages-collecting system for their running plan."</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"I see, they even had been set some kind of long-range telescope or radar like observatory equipments and messages receiving cabin-pedestals to detect the subject which they wanted to chase, and tried efforts to understand the overall circumstance where they stayed in. These two Hanese words '臣, 妾' might just reveal such equipments's basic form in very ancient time, according to their pictogram's possible meanings which were different to the other later texts and scriptures in Hanese history."</div>
<div class="draft--imgNormal draft-block"><img src="https://images.vocus.cc/8232be19-2bf7-480d-bde4-3ed9d920b876.jpg"><figcaption class="imageCaption draft-block" style="cursor:text;display:block"><span style="font-weight: bold; ">【根據古代象形字可能的其它意像，「臣」字有可能描繪自類似「瞭朢觀測器」或「雷達望遠鏡」的遠古偵察儀器，而「妾」字也可能表示「訊息接收站」或「電波偵訊座」的意思。】</span></figcaption></div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"It's reasonable, usually the journalists need some kind of information collecting tools include optical instruments, even some other progressive message-detecting and watching equipments for getting more evidences in their investigation about news, that's why '君' and '臣' and '妾' had very close relationship in the ancient time."</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"As the news collectors and predictors, those ancient journalists were pleasant to hold and appreciate more information about the turning possibilities related to the future than normal people, that's why they could speedily decide how to change themselves moving directions and put themselves into the best turning ways. This situation was noted at forth yao in this qua."</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"If concerned the good prizes, during the turning times, many people seemed like be willing to run for the honorable awards, they even made teams to participate in the competitions far away from their hometowns or native places. Actually,  some of the awards might react with something about the awesomely anticipated changes in the future."</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"At last, when many people gradually started to run for the very fantasy or phantom subjects and without concerning the useful and substantial benefits in reality, that meant the real world might be going to arrive at an awesome turning point of the other changing time, and the extreme goal which the runners would really like to run for might be to make the dreams of long-range telepathy and supernatural abilities come true."</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left"><span style="font-weight: bold; ">在追逐中獲得成果、在逃脫時達成心願，往往振奮人心、聲勢大壯，感到信心十足的想要繼續爭取更遠大的目標、突破更強大的界限，甚至大胆的去追逐一般人認為是不可能的任務、熱切的投入世俗中認為是荒誕不切實際的未來。但是，遠大的目標和強大的界限又是什麼呢？該如何去面對和突破呢？</span></div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"Yes! Something might be regarded as the impossible mission or ridiculous attempt, even crazy and insane, but sometimes the brands of new concepts had been just the turning corners to find a possibly realistic way."</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"That's why the next qua '大壯' was going to talk about the most strong power or great defensive wall, that must be the most difficult way for running and getting through......"</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"If you already got arrival at the top of the world, the highest sky-mountain,........ Then in your next steps........what will be the most difficult thing which you like to do?"</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"I might look the great world under my feet and naturally look the great sky above my head, too. Maybe I will be staring blankly, stunning, losing in thought....... Maybe hope someone takes me to get out of there...…before I'm regretting for those hard efforts in my past running......."</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"Maybe you will just need a joke to let you break the mind wall of yourself. Because of you might find not only you had ever got arrival at that highest point, and you might wonder how they could leave there and what were their turning ways?........"</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"Was that a secret? Or a mind code which was the most difficult decoding course?........"</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"No, it's not so difficult, that way will be very obvious to look out from a mirror,......sky-mountain......mountain-sky......, if you cannot go up to the sky above your head and also no dare to go down to the world under your feet, then......why don't you just live in the great mountain which seemed like a large national natural park?........."</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"Yes! if you feel no place to hide and no place to find, the great mountain just supply the plenty places to let you turn around for a long time........ just like the great ocean,........ amazing paradise,...... mysterious labyrinth,....... Or you may try to move along the other big choice -- prepare to go through the next boundary and face the mightily strongest innovatory power or solidest border line........."</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left"><span style="font-weight: bold; ">The border line on the beach was always changing with sea waves. When I stayed with Mermaid E. on the beach, seemed like both of us had been escaped from each others's familiar home place and tried to run for something misty and didn't know which way of our future will turn into, but we knew there was no place to hide,.........sunlight was shinning, air was passed-able, water was transparent, and of course there might be no heavy border between our spirits, too..</span>..........</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left"><span style="font-weight: bold; ">Sometimes the heavy border might be also the heaviest burden when seriously fixed it as an unchangeable or an inflexible dividing line, after many and many years long time later, it might just leave a great memory for visiting and sighing..........</span></div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left"><span style="font-weight: bold; ">P.S.1. 《易經》是談變化的經典，而「遁卦」也有大轉變、big turning 的意思；無獨有偶的是，在生物學的演化論中也有所謂的「突變」(mutation)。面對意外災難時，逃難的選擇可能也是演化突變的關鍵影響因素之一。例如：洪水或其它威脅突然降臨時，猿猴當下可能選擇就地爬上高高的樹木避難、食用樹上的水果，於是逐漸演化成長臂短腿、長腳趾和弓身的體態；人類則選擇涉過淺水、奔逃到地勢高處、手持工具抵抗及挖掘根莖類食物充飢，於是逐漸演化為長手長腿和直立的身軀。也許可以這麼說，逃難時躲避的愈遠，演化的差異就愈大。<br></span></div>
