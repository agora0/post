<h1><a href="https://allpoetry.com/poem/15713775-For-the-nervous-system-by-Simon-Cheng-Wai-Him" target="_blank">For the nervous system</a></h1><p>Venetian blinds are getting ill;</p><p>By the holiday was coming late.</p><p>The effort of surrender is vain,</p><p>Which vein and nerve coiled gnarled</p><p>with the blinds swing;</p><p>The nervous waves</p><p>In a long red-letter day and the rusting</p><p>sounds like the free fall;</p><p>It is in front of the me, fidgeting.</p>
