<div class="draft--imgNormal draft-block"><img src="https://images.vocus.cc/1226e377-0d3a-4f5c-832e-27e33e82daa0.jpg"><figcaption class="imageCaption draft-block" style="cursor:text;display:block"></figcaption></div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left"><span style="font-weight: bold; ">亨，無咎。利貞，利有攸往。--</span> 高興追求長久感情、持之以恆聯繫在心，本來是沒錯；敏銳偵測再三思量，感情一事何必緊張，悠遊自在有何不妥？......雷聲大作、空氣震動，急促呼嘯的風，吹的車搖晃、鈴乍響，短暫迴盪在人稀的街道上，煞是恆長在心中盤旋著餘響，久久不散........</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left"><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; ">初六：浚恆，貞凶，無攸利。/ 變卦雷天大壯 -- </span>起初急把感情放，深信永恆是堅強，往後為此費思量，擔心變化與無常。啊！這樣......怎麼輕鬆面對？怎麼悠遊自在？指天的誓言、緊握的倆手、真實的瀾漫、怒放的深情，如今何在？...... <span style="font-weight: bold; ">(P.S. 此處「浚」解爲「深」。)</span></div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left"><span style="font-weight: bold; ">九二：悔亡。/ 變卦雷山小過 -- </span>追求永恆的感情，一旦感情出了差錯，往往心生後悔和空忙一場的感覺，甚至心懷自責和犯了過錯的情緒啊！</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left"><span style="font-weight: bold; ">九三：不恆其德，或承之羞，貞吝。/ 變卦雷水解 --</span> 也許就是因為不能恆久把感情當作一種生活中可以學習和養成的習慣，或是羞愧於承擔來到面前的感情，所以感情之路纔會愈走愈窄，甚至覺得自己受困其中而欲求解脫。<span style="font-weight: bold; ">(P.S. 此處「德」解爲「直覺的行為」或「習慣」。)</span></div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left"><span style="font-weight: bold; ">九四：田無禽。/ 變卦地風升 -- </span>稻穀不成熟，田裡無禽鳥；感情的培養也不是一天兩天的事啊！只要有恆心的往來互動，也許會節節高升、喜上眉梢呢！</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left"><span style="font-weight: bold; ">六五：恆其德貞，婦人吉，夫子凶。/ 變卦澤風大過 -- </span>恆久於感情的覺察和表達，把它當作一種可以探究和學習的生活習慣，通常婦女欣喜於此，夫子卻百般遲疑。難道，學習感情的表達是難為情的事嗎？是太過份的事嗎？是很沒骨氣的事嗎？<span style="font-weight: bold; ">(P.S. 此處「貞」解爲「探究」；「吉」解爲「喜」；「凶」解爲「行動中斷於停頓推延或心智沉陷於遲疑盤算」。)</span></div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left"><span style="font-weight: bold; ">上六：振恆，凶。/ 變卦火風鼎 --</span> 感情的振作和恆久的維繫雖然不是單方面的事，但是在周圍的推波助瀾和鼓譟聲中，也可能燃起熱情的熊熊火焰。如同鼎下有助燃的鼓風爐一般，短時間就能使鼎中的湯水加熱成沸騰的蒸汽、快速將湯水中的食物攪混的爛熟。...... 這也是火熱生風的鍋爐或不斷運轉的高能量噴射引擎可以當作推進器或發電機的原理之一啊！......</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"As the wind blowing through a tree, the leaves on the tree might tremble a while, because of the air was trying to find the paths between the leaves to easily flow. The powerful wind even could destruct a wall......"</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"When we shouted between two parallel walls, we might hear our own shouting sounds resonated again and again in the space between two walls, because of there were some sound-waves could not find an exit way and turn around between such two walls....... That's so called '恆'."</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"And when we stood between two parallel mirrors, we might see our own numerous reflected portrait-images between two mirrors, because of there also were some light-waves could not find an exit way between such two mirrors, was it the same effect related to '恆'?"</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"What I interest with is that the passionate feelings between two close lovers might be felt like endless by both of them, they persevered in connecting with the emotion and imagination of each other, and built an enclosed space without being bothered by another one, that might make them feel they seem like already have got a permanent passionate world belonged to both of them......... It looked so everlasting in such moment as falling in love with each other........"</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"I know what you mean,..... If one side of the mirrors disappeared, then the numerous reflecting images between them would no longer exist...... It might be a little sorry,...... but from the other sight, the light between both sides could find an exit way and get more freedom, isn't it?......."</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"I had been wondering why the universe was created from a Big Bang which was theorized by some of the cosmological physicists? The original particles of the universe must try to escape from an enclosed point, and that enclosed point might be a bit like some kind of binaural diode, then in a moment it was activated and exploded out to create the whole universe by all of the very micro particles which already existed in such point........"</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"So, those original particles which had got freedom long-long time ago are still keeping running fast in every possible way and arriving at every possible edge in the time-space far away from the starting basic big-bang point at this moment when we are talking, but why we are still staying here? Do you think now we are also getting arrival at some kind of edge?......"</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"What you say let me have a little confuse. If a person walks on one of the long ways toward a termination, he must know the edge of the end point is still far away from him in a distance, but how can we say that he already have got arrival at some kind of edge?"</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"Because of the edge was already existent in the beginning when he set up the route, no matter what is his moving speed, no matter what’re the details of his long journey on his way, from the macro vision, he didn't move out of the enclosed time-space which defined by the start-point and the end-point. That means he is always staying inside the edges of that preset time-space......."</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"From this word "恆" which involved a symbol of '忄', I think it might express a feature about the 'mind', and seemed like there were some messages always busily running inside the mind and couldn't stop, only if the fixed link of the nervous transmitting was temporally weakly loosed or disconnected......"</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"The symbol '亙' in the right part of '恆' was graphed as the moon or a ship between two edge lines for presenting the meaning about the moon looked like always move between horizons or a ship always sailed between two shores, maybe the nervous system in human body also has such similar bi-path transmitting function to build the whole body's healthy condition."</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"That means, an entirely eternal passion between lovers must be built by a long term of the interactive communication, and it might be able to be constructed firmly with some kind of learning....... It's not just simply equal to build the relationship by contract......."</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"I see, that's why the third yao in this qua had mentioned about the love and affection might be a learnable habit for more eternal relationship between a couple of lovers, but.......the following words in fifth yao also revealed that most of the female seemed like more pleasant and willing to learn such affective courses than most of the male........."</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"Maybe........during that time, most of the men have borne and raised to be a warrior at all, and not a worrier about love.......... "</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"Anyway,.......the love affair was not decided without reference to the other partner's involving, when under the surrounding encouragements and waving push, it might be aroused quickly with the passionate emotion and speedily get the tight connection. Just like the meal could thoroughly well cooked inside an enclosed cauldron by the surrounding heat in a short time. Such effect had been noted at the sixth yao in this qua, and that was also one of the principles about the hot boiling steamer and jet engine for the moving propulsion and the electricity generator......."</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"But if the love affair had a precise formula or constant sequence of processes, even had the prepared scripts and lyrics to express the emotion, and always could speedily get the effectiveness, would it be lack of plenty imagination, unexpected surprise and the exciting of pursuing, then became a little boring?......."</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left"><span style="font-weight: bold; ">感情的發展過程如果有固定的指導原則和公式可循，甚至好像有預先寫好的劇本、準備好的劇情和台詞，那是不是反而覺得缺少想像的空間、意外的驚喜、轉折的浪漫和追求的興奮感呢？恆久致力於某件事情，也許就算是一種追求，那麼既然有追求或追逐，不也有逃遯、逃避或躲藏嗎？</span></div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"When you tried your best and spent a long time to run or chase for something, that's just the pursuing. But if there is pursuing or chasing, will there be escaping or hiding, too?"</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"That's why the next qua '遯' was going to talk about pursue and escape, chase and hide, seek or flee. To the whole I.E. Scripture, the 33rd qua '遯' was also the awesome start-point of the third quarter...... which might be going to move on the way by the autumn time in a round of the ancient humankind's civilization."</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"Due to the graphical hexagram of the next qua '遯' was combined with '111-sky' and '100-mountain', it seemed like mark the highest place above the ground that the normal human could get arrival at. Did it also reveal the possibility that such highest point was also some kind of rising extreme to the ancient humankind's civilization before it was going to decline?......."</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"Sunrise, sunset, .......then moonrise again......., they looked like always run for each other in the sky but never touched by each other. When the moon met with sun and caused it eclipsed, the sun seemed like temporally disappear, so did the numerous stars which surrounded the lodestar in the northern night sky......."</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"Maybe the love between celestial stars is not the touchable love, they just run and run, chasing and chasing....... Because of the pursuing and the escaping between them might be the natural reactions as their gravities carrying powerful magnets......."</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left"><span style="font-weight: bold; ">At that moment, suddenly the winds made a strong blowing and blow down many leaves with rustles to the water surface from the trees beside the villa house....... And those falling and floating leaves speedily moved like lively fishes to turn around and surround both of Mermaid E. and I as a circle when we closely stayed in the warming pool........ Then I almost could smell a little cool atmosphere coming of the autumn season in the future........</span></div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"Do you want dive around with me for a while?...... I know a more warm cave under sea water.........  "</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"Sure!........ It's the best time for fleeing to the deep......... I'm just thinking around something about why the third quarter in The I.E. Scripture was started from '遯'....... Though this Hanese word '遯' was a little horribly sounded like English word 'dune', do you feel it might be related to a movement or a situation about 'turn around'?......."</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"It's not impossible, because of this Hanese word '遯' was combined with '辶' and '豚'....... '辶' was a symbol related to movement, and '豚' was just sounded like 'tun'...... Was this word more closing with 'turn' in ancient time?......"</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"Yes! When we tried to flee away, we might turn ourselves around to look for a safe and easy way......... And if we could take a moving tool with powerful engine which was projecting the thundering wind, that might be easier for speedily going.........."</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"Thundering wind?....... Maybe it was the wind made by thunderbird as it was flying, not made by jet plane in the very ancient time....... Who knows?....... Or it just told that follow the wind might let us feel more easy to go on moving?........"</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"Then, what is the more definite meaning about turn?...... Turn around, turn back, turn away, turn against, turn on, turn off, turn into,......... There were many possibilities........"</div>
