<div class="draft--imgNormal draft-block"><div><img src="https://images.vocus.cc/23a3ccf1-29e1-468b-aa6d-faba8be92372.jpg"><figcaption class="imageCaption draft-block" style="cursor:text;display:block"></figcaption></div></div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left"><span style="font-weight: bold; ">利艱貞 -- </span>明白地下掩埋或水中湮滅的不明物體、動用敏銳精密的探測方法和儀器，這是十分艱難的偵察任務。如同在睡眠之中想要得到夢境靈光的啓示；又如同搭乘時光旅行的機器，回到過去尋找關鍵人物。</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left"></div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left"><span style="font-weight: bold; ">初九：明夷于飛，垂其翼。君子于行，三日不食，有攸往，主人有言。/ 變卦地山謙 --</span> 還記得「謙卦」裡記載著人類文明曾經瀕臨覆滅的驚險事蹟嗎？那個從地底飛出來的龐大怪物，似乎在出現之前垂著羽翼、蟄伏甚久呢！君子此時要進行考古挖掘的探索，最好在行前節衣縮食、減輕體重、作好體能訓練的長期準備，纔能悠然輕鬆的前往啊！不論如何，此行的主要目的是要找到當時目擊怪物的關鍵人物、得到當時文明爲何覆滅或隱匿的相關訊息。<span style="font-weight: bold; ">(P.S.此處「三日」解爲「多日」或「長期」。)</span></div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left"><span style="font-weight: bold; ">六二：明夷，夷于左股，用拯馬壯吉。/ 變卦地天泰 -- </span>文明覆滅的可能原因，就像人體不良於行，此時交通與交流的能力受阻、佐証事務進行的資訊來源和線索難以為繼，甚至不計血汗、意圖通過快速的載具或昂貴的設備來暢通內外的連結，以便拯救載浮載沉、過度福泰而虛榮的壯盛假相。這是我們探測分析一座埋藏在地下的、龐大的古代陵墓空間所得到的一種結論。<span style="font-weight: bold; ">(P.S.此處「左股」解爲「佐証的線索」。)</span></div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left"><span style="font-weight: bold; ">九三：明夷于南狩，得其大首，不可疾貞。/ 變卦地雷復 --</span> 文明覆滅的可能原因，就像大舉進行狩獵或頻頻發動戰爭，雖然一時獲取很大的獵物、奪得貪圖的事物，卻可能因為受傷或染上一再復發、不可治癒和不明究理的疾病而衰亡。這是我們在南方的考古遺址中，經由分析及檢視覆蓋在地底下的古文明殘存遺物和遺骸所得到的一種結論。從那些遠古戰場的遺址中，甚至出土了不少令人感到震撼的、威力強大的武器呢！</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left"><span style="font-weight: bold; ">六四：入于左腹，獲明夷之心，于出門庭。/ 變卦雷火豐 -- </span>如果把文明的發展視為人體的成長，那麼位於體內左腹的胰臟可以說是與文明的覆滅息息相關，從這裡也許可以獲得文明覆滅的核心原因。廣闊燦爛的文明如同浸淫於豐富熱鬧的盛宴，如果人體吸收熱量過高、消化不良或臟器功能衰竭，也會疾病纏身啊！這是我們在飲食器具非常豐富發達的考古遺址中，檢驗許多在豪門大庭的建築遺跡中出土的遺骸死因所得到的一種結論。</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left"><span style="font-weight: bold; ">六五：箕子之明夷，利貞。/ 變卦水火既濟 -- </span>經由對於傳說中「箕子文明」覆滅過程的考古發掘、詳細分析偵測之後，有了另一種說法：當時他們可能極端的把事物區分為菁華和糙糠，不思資源回收和節省能源之道，最後因為過於滿足現狀、凡事只求合於常規常理、不思創新開拓，結果失去應變的能力，文明便逐漸衰微而隱匿，最後竟然沉沒在水底。</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left"><span style="font-weight: bold; ">上六：不明晦，初登于天，後入于地。/ 變卦山火賁 -- </span>經過許多有關文明覆滅原因的考察探索，不明原因、莫測晦深的案例還有很多充滯在檔案庫中。最令人驚歎與耐人尋味的案例就是：曾經夜夜燈火通明、建築通天高塔的興盛文明，在火山大規模噴發之後的短暫期間，被炙熱的岩漿和厚厚的火山灰掩埋在地底深處。</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left"></div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"An ancient philosopher Laos in the Hanese cultural history had told: To see and cannot find is called 夷, to hear and cannot know is called 希."</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"Yes! I know that...... 老子曰：「視之不見謂之夷、聽之不聞謂之希。」。「夷」是一種或許還可以聽見、卻不容易看見的狀態，有點接近「隱」的意思。"</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"早期甲骨文中，象形字「夷」似乎是用「箭矢迅速飛升，只聽到箭矢飛升的聲音而看不見箭矢形影」的象徵符號來表示這種狀態呢！那麼，「明夷」不也就是想辦法去明白那些難以明白的事物嗎？"</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"Sure! This ancient Hanese word '明夷' seemed like very close to some of the features about mineral, mine, miniature.…..in English words. That's why this qua had ever recorded a series of works about the archeological businesses."</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left"></div>
<div class="draft--imgNormal draft-block"><div><img src="https://images.vocus.cc/d5ae5671-2a45-4ea1-a480-0fbc8300e6b6.jpg"><figcaption class="imageCaption draft-block" style="cursor:text;display:block"></figcaption></div></div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"From the other point of view, this Hanese word '夷' seemed like be written as presenting the intestinal system in the human body with a curve line which looked like 'S' in its ancient pictogram. That's why it had some meanings related to digestion, extinguishment, or invisibility, just liked the mine under the earth."</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"During this qua, I think those ancient archeologists might find the progressive technology for detecting the underground minerals, which were deeply buried and hard to discover. Because of they might have already got the knowledge about radiation materials in the period of last qua."</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"We can see the hexagram of this qua was consisted as 'Fire under Earth', that pointed a possibility: Those ancient scientists might try to detect the buried things by comparing the different radiations or heats for recognizing what things might hide under the earth."</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"Actually the radiocarbon,......the technology about accurately detecting the decaying date of the Carbon-14 which was discovered by modern scientists in 1940, and this knowledge had led the archeology toward a new era."</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"Sometimes the thoughts or ideas, or some kind of emotion might hide in our minds and only could be known by our self-consciousnesses through the sleeping dreams. By means of the cultural-DNA buried in our sub-consciousness, maybe we also be able to get some inspiration and information about the situations of our related ancient civilizations through the time-spaces of dreams."</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"Do you know there was an ancient Roman goddess of wisdom and sponsor of the arts, trade, and strategy? ...... And she was born with weapons from the head of Jupiter."</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"You mean Minerva?...... Since the second century BC, the Romans equated her with the Greek goddess Athena. She was the virgin goddess of music, poetry, medicine, wisdom, commerce, weaving, crafts, and magic."</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"I think the spirit of this qua might be closely related to the ancient goddess Minerva. According to the new generation in The I.E. Scripture was started at last qua '晉', those ancient archeologists might try to dig out more precious wisdoms left by the more ancient civilizations which had been lost."</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"Some archeologists had ever told that the ancient Roman culture’s Minerva might be impacted by the ancient Greek cultural Goddess of Athen -- Athena, which might inherit from Athena, which was the plural form of Mukānal in Mycenaean culture on Crete Island near to Greece in the Mediterranean Sea. And the ruins of the ancient Mycenae City or Myces were just another famous name about a lost ancient civilization on Earth."</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"From all of the lyrics in this qua, they seemed like pay more interest to know how those ancient lost civilizations had been ruined,  crashed or disappeared........, due to the reasonable worries about the future of their own civilization's development during the climate changing and hot war times which had been mentioned in last qua."</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"So, what they had found?"</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"According to the lyrics from second yao to sixth yao, there had been noted down five reasons of ruin about those lost civilizations: lost the abilities of communication and mobilization; frequent war or mass-hunting and lost to diagnose and treat the un-identified diseases; indigestion caused by too much eat and drink or lost the vital function of pancreas in the body; over-discrimination and lost the ability about environmental protection with creation; the destructive damage caused by the incident exploding of the great volcano........In last yao, the lyrics also noted that actually many collected files about the strange cases of the lost civilizations kept in the database were still sealed and uneasy to explain......"</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"Fire under the Earth, the symbolic image about the hexagram of this qua seemed like have pointed a most possible reason related to the ruin of the ancient lost civilizations, too....... It might be something contained very powerful burning heat inside the earth that we had never seen before, just like the super underground volcano."</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"So, if the humankind's civilizations on the earth will be periodically ruined and not last forever, what will become the most valuable thing? This awesome question must exist in those ancient people's minds after they digging out many stories about the lost civilizations through the archeological research."</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"That's why the next qua '家人' was going to talk about the family. As running for the glorious future of the great civilization which perhaps will become the dusts in someday, why don't pay more attention to cherish the real family and hold the existing happiness of the home life?"</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left"></div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left"><span style="font-weight: bold; ">經由考古發現，許多興盛繁榮的文明也會在不斷擴張之後毀於一旦。如同季節的寒暑交替、萬物的生發枯朽，一個文明的覆滅和隱匿可能只是早晚的問題。既然如此，意圖追求未來可能飛灰湮滅的文明榮景，不如把握實實在在的家庭幸福、珍惜與家人共處的時光啊！</span></div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left"></div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"Do you have family?......" I was always curious about this question and asked Mermaid E.</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"Family?....... What is the family? Are we a family?" Mermaid E. seemed like have a little confuse about my words.</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"Where you from?...... Whom you lived with before knowing me on the beach?......" I kept asking.</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"Mermaid E. came from the sea, lived with fishes and turtles, seagulls and dolphins,...... winds and rains, sea waves and sun lights......." She answered.</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"No,......... I mean do you have parents? Father and mother? Brothers or sisters?...... Or else?...... Such like grand father and grand mother, uncles or aunts?...... " I said.</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"I don't know....... I just remember when I could start to see and hear, I opened my eyes and found myself was lying on a cluster of very soft sea-grasses, numerous small shining fishes and a giant air bubble were covering around me...... Those fishes kept supplying me oxygen in that giant bubble by blowing the air from their mouths for a long time....... I gradually woke up, and learned to follow those fishes and lived with them, then I knew more new friends in the great ocean, included my familiar big turtles......" Mermaid E. said.</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"Yes! I had wondered why I slept under the deep sea before waking, I had tried to find where my home and my family was....... One day, those familiar and kind fishes led me to a sunken ship in the deep and dark sea, I probably understood what had happened to me and my families......." She kept saying.</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"I'm really sorry about that!...... " I was astonished about her past event and her surviving legend.</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"In Hanese, '家' meant home, and '家人' could mean 'family' or some kind of 'expert' who was familiar or skillful on a subject of research or working job. No matter what, '家人' might have some characters about familiar, live or work together......."</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"But I feel a little weird about this Hanese pictograms word '家' which was consisted by a shape of a house-roof and a symbol related to swine or hog or pig."</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"I think '家' might have been a kind of house which was built by the farmers for raising the hogs in ancient Hanese agricultural fields. It gradually became the iconic building of the homeland in their country, then the meaning of this word '家' gradually became similar to 'home' in later."</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"The other possibility about the home might involve the hogs is.......if humankind had been raised by some familiar animals during a period of hard time on the earth?......."</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"'家' must be always a home place for gathering and covering the families, but how about the lost families whom you might never seen before?......"</div>
<div class="draft-block draft--p left">"Do you mean......some of the extraterrestrials or aliens might be humankind's lost families?...… That's just the other awesome subject that the next qua was going to discuss....... Actually the very ancient civilization in China already had ever faced such unusual question......"</div>
