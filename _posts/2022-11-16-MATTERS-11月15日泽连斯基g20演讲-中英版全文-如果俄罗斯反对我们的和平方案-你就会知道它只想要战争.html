<p>01</p><p>—</p><p><br></p><p><strong>泽连斯基演讲</strong></p><p><br></p><figure class="image"><img src="https://assets.matters.news/embed/347dd488-8bf4-4bb7-9db8-17ffab917711.jpeg" data-asset-id="347dd488-8bf4-4bb7-9db8-17ffab917711" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption></figure><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>尊敬的维多多总统！</p><p>尊敬的同仁们！世界上与我们站在一起的多数人！</p><p><br></p><p>我在用乌克兰语向你们讲话，但在你们每个人的桌子面前，都可以看到用你们各自国家语言写的我们的提议，以示我们的尊重。</p><p><br></p><p>我刚从赫尔松市返回我们的首都。</p><p>赫尔松是我国南部的重要城市，也是俄罗斯在2月24日之后唯一占领的区域中心。</p><p>现在赫尔松已经被解放了。</p><p><br></p><p>这意味着什么呢？对于乌克兰来说，我们国防军的这次解放行动让人想起过去成为战争转折点的许多战役。</p><p>虽然最终的胜利仍然需要去争取，但那些战役之后人们已经知道谁会取得胜利了。</p><p>这就像，比如说，诺曼底登陆日——盟军登陆诺曼底。这还不是与邪恶斗争的最后一战，但它已经决定了整个事件的后续进程。</p><p>这就是我们现在的感受。</p><p><br></p><p>现在——当赫尔松获得了自由。</p><p>为了把我们的整片国土从俄国人手中解放出来，我们还得再战斗一段时间……战斗！</p><p>但是，如果无论如何胜利都会属于我们了，而且我们都对此深信不疑的时候，难道我们不应该尝试一下实施我们的和平方案，去挽救成千上万人的生命并保护世界免遭进一步的动荡吗？</p><p><br></p><p>这就是为什么我想展示我们对和平之路的愿景——如何真正实现它。</p><p>不仅是为我们，也为你们所有人、以及你们的盟友和合作伙伴。</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>今年 9 月我在联合国大会上的发言中，提出了乌克兰的和平方案，一个追求世界和平的方案。</p><p>就在世界期盼从疫情的打击中恢复过来时，俄罗斯战争引发了一系列新的全球性挑战。这一切必须被阻止！</p><p>需要实施一套解决方案。我希望相关的对话是公开的，而不是在幕后。我希望对话是具体的，而不是泛泛而谈。</p><p><br></p><p>也许我的发言会超过规定的时间限制。</p><p>但和平值得。</p><p><br></p><p>我希望这场俄罗斯的侵略战争能够在《联合国宪章》和国际法的基础上公正地结束，而不是“稀里糊涂地”——这是联合国秘书长安东尼奥·古特雷斯的恰当表述。</p><p>不应要求乌克兰在良知、主权、领土和独立问题上作出妥协。我们尊重规则，我们是信守诺言的民族。</p><p><br></p><p>乌克兰一直是维护和平行动的引领者，全世界有目共睹。如果俄罗斯说它有诚意结束这场战争，那就让它用行动来证明吧。</p><p>显然，俄罗斯的话并不可信，也不会有俄罗斯签了之后转头就违约的《明斯克协议3》。</p><p>如果没有恢复和平的切实行动，那就意味着俄罗斯只是想再次欺骗你们，欺骗世界，只是想在它的失败变得特别明显的时候暂时冻结战争。</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>我们不会让俄罗斯缓过气来、增强自己的力量，然后又开始一系列新的恐怖和全球动荡。</p><p>我相信现在是必须并且可以制止俄罗斯的破坏性战争的时候了。</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>因此，以下是乌克兰的建议：</p><p><br></p><p><strong>首先，辐射和核安全。</strong></p><p><br></p><p>没有人有权利用放射性灾难来敲诈世界。这是一条公理。</p><p><br></p><p>然而，在全世界的注视下，俄罗斯却把我们的扎波罗热核电站变成了一颗随时可能爆炸的放射性炸弹。</p><p>辐射云会去哪里？也许朝向欧盟领土，也许去土耳其，也许去中东。</p><p>我认为即使仅仅是对这种可能性的设想都是犯罪！</p><p><br></p><p>必须恢复辐射安全。国际原子能机构已经提供了相应的建议，确认了我们一再提出的所有风险。因此，俄罗斯必须立即将其所有武装分子撤出扎波罗热核电站范围。该站必须立即移交给国际原子能机构和乌克兰人员来控制。必须立即恢复核电站与电网的正常连接，以免影响反应堆的稳定性。</p><p><br></p><p>我们提议向所有乌克兰核电站派遣国际原子能机构工作组——4个核电站，总共 15 个核装置。再加上已经关闭并处于保护状态的切尔诺贝利核电站。这些小组可以核实针对乌克兰核设施的敌对活动是否确实已经停止。</p><p><br></p><p>需要多长时间来实施？</p><p>如果俄罗斯真的准备好遵守其此前违反的放射性安全规定，它最早明天就可以开始扎波罗热核电站的非军事化。</p><p><br></p><p>俄罗斯官员诉诸核武器的疯狂威胁也是如此。核讹诈没有任何借口，也不能有任何借口。</p><p>尊敬的19国集团领导人，我感谢你们阐明了这一点。</p><p>然而，请务必用你们所有的力量让俄罗斯放弃核威胁。这种努力的基础可以是《布达佩斯备忘录》和各签署国相应的能力。</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>其次，粮食安全。</strong></p><p><br></p><p>感谢联合国、土耳其和其他合作伙伴的强力参与，我们展示了一小部分人的合作是怎么恢复许多人的粮食安全的。</p><p>我相信我们的出口谷物计划应该无限期延长——不管战争何时结束。</p><p>获得食物的权利是世界上每个人的基本权利。</p><p><br></p><p>自 7 月以来，乌克兰已通过海运出口了超过 1000 万吨食品。我们还可以每月增加数百万吨的出口量。为此我建议将谷物出口计划扩大到我们的其他港口——特别是尼古拉耶夫地区的尼古拉耶夫和“奥尔维亚”港口。</p><p><br></p><p>同时我也呼吁所有国家——尤其是贵国，尊敬的 19 国集团领导人——加入我们的倡议，帮助最贫穷的人获得食物。</p><p><br></p><p>我们已经发起了这个计划——“来自乌克兰的粮食”。</p><p>第一艘船——Nord Vind——载着 2.7 万吨小麦启程前往埃塞俄比亚。</p><p>这是每年可以养活近 100,000 人的数量。</p><p>乌克兰可以有很多这样的船，能够帮助贫穷国家的很多人免于饥饿。</p><p>乌克兰今年可以出口4500万吨粮食，让其中很大一部分用于受苦最深的人。</p><p><br></p><p>我们到底在建议什么呢？其实就是每个国家都可以加入计划并作出具体贡献，成为一同战胜饥饿和粮食危机的共同创造者。</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>第三，能源安全。</strong></p><p><br></p><p>你们所有人都可以看到俄罗斯的恐怖活动现在的目的，就是试图将寒冷变成武器，对付成百上千万人的武器。</p><p>我们大约 40% 的能源基础设施被占领者使用俄罗斯导弹和伊朗无人机摧毁。每个星期，俄罗斯都会炸毁我们的发电厂、变压器和供电线路。</p><p><br></p><p>这种恐怖活动的一个连带目标是防止我们的电力出口到邻国，而这本可以极大地帮助他们稳定能源状况并降低消费者价格。</p><p><br></p><p>俄罗斯有志于能源危机。而我们都应该有志于结束这种恐怖活动。</p><p><br></p><p>我感谢我们所有已经帮助乌克兰提供防空和导弹防御系统的合作伙伴。这使我们能够击落一些俄罗斯导弹和伊朗无人机。但我们必须充分保护我们的天空。恳请各位增加相应的帮助！</p><p><br></p><p>我们已经提议联合国派专家团前往乌克兰关键能源基础设施点，评估损坏范围和修复需求，并防止其进一步被破坏。</p><p>我们需要加快派遣这个专家团的速度！</p><p>这将是国际社会对稳定乌克兰和欧洲能源局势以及全球能源市场的具体贡献。</p><p><br></p><p>但是，不管世界如何决定，俄罗斯一天都不会放弃对乌克兰能源生产和供水和供热设施的攻击。让俄罗斯通过停止恐怖活动来证明它真的对恢复和平感兴趣。</p><p><br></p><p>我们还必须迈出根本性的一步，使能源不再被用作武器。应该引入对俄罗斯能源资源的价格限制。</p><p><br></p><p>如果俄罗斯试图剥夺乌克兰、欧洲和世界上所有能源消费者的可预测性和价格稳定性，那么解决这个问题的办法应该是强制限制俄罗斯的出口价格，使出口价格不高于生产成本。</p><p>这是公平的。如果你拿走一些东西，那么世界也有权从你那里拿走。</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>第四，释放所有囚犯和被驱逐者。</strong></p><p><br></p><p>成千上万我们的人民——军人和平民——被俄罗斯囚禁。他们遭受残酷的折磨——这是大规模的虐待！</p><p><br></p><p>此外，我们知道姓名的有 11000 名儿童被强行驱逐到俄罗斯。完全清楚他们都有家庭，但还是将他们与父母分开。</p><p>除了我们了解数据的儿童之外，还有数以万计被强行驱逐的，我们只能间接地了解到他们。其中有许多人的父母在俄罗斯的空袭中丧生，现在他们被关押在杀害他们父母的国家。</p><p><br></p><p>还有数十万被驱逐的成年人，你们会看到俄罗斯发动的战争造成了多大的人道主义灾难。</p><p>还有政治犯——被关押在俄罗斯和临时占领领土、特别是关押在克里米亚的乌克兰公民。</p><p><br></p><p>我们必须解救所有这些人！</p><p><br></p><p>我要指出，我们没有得到红十字国际委员会的支持。</p><p>我们没有看到他们在全力争取进入关押乌克兰战俘和政治犯的集中营。</p><p>他们也没有帮助寻找被驱逐的乌克兰人。</p><p>这种自甘堕落是红十字会作为一个曾经备受尊重组织的自我毁灭。</p><p><br></p><p>我们不能等。</p><p>因此，我们必须为了唯一现实的解救囚犯模式——“整体换俘”而团结起来。</p><p>解救所有被驱逐到俄罗斯的儿童和成人也是如此。</p><p><br></p><p>我感谢合作伙伴的努力，使许多被俄罗斯人俘虏的乌克兰人和外国公民获释。</p><p>让你的领导力和现在在场的其他领导人真诚的心，帮助其他乌克兰人获得自由吧。</p><p><br></p><p><strong>第五，执行联合国宪章，恢复乌克兰的领土完整和世界秩序。</strong></p><p><br></p><p>《联合国宪章》第二条非常明确地定义了一切、俄罗斯在这场战争中所违反的一切。</p><p>因此，我们必须重塑国际法的有效性——不与侵略者妥协，因为《联合国宪章》不能部分、选择性或“随意”适用。</p><p><br></p><p>俄罗斯必须在联合国大会有关决议和适用的、具有法律约束力的国际文件框架内重申乌克兰的领土完整。</p><p><br></p><p>这一点没有谈判余地。</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>第六，俄罗斯军队撤出乌克兰、停止敌对行动。</strong></p><p><br></p><p>对于如何实现这一点应该有很清晰的理解。</p><p>俄罗斯必须从乌克兰领土上撤出所有军队和武装团体，必须恢复乌克兰对与俄罗斯邻界所有关卡的控制。</p><p>直至真正和完全地停止敌对行动。</p><p><br></p><p>每延误一天都意味着乌克兰人有新的死亡，对世界有新的威胁，以及由于俄罗斯继续侵略而导致的损失疯狂增加——世界上每个人都有所损失。</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>第七，正义。</strong></p><p><br></p><p>这是能激发最强烈情感的东西。</p><p><br></p><p>在每个地方，当我们解放我们的土地时，我们都会看到同一个情况——俄罗斯留下的酷刑室和受害者的大规模墓葬。</p><p><br></p><p>北部的布查和其他城市被占领后发现了这种情况，哈尔科夫地区也有这种情况，我们现在在赫尔松地区观察到的情况也是如此。</p><p><br></p><p>截至今天，我们掌握了在俄罗斯空袭中丧生的430 名儿童的完整信息。只是孩子！还只是那些我们完全了解情况的。</p><p><br></p><p>在俄罗斯仍然控制的领土上有多少乱葬坑？我们会在马里乌波尔看到什么？</p><p><br></p><p>这就是为什么世界应该支持设立特别法庭来处理俄罗斯侵略乌克兰的罪行，并建立一个国际机制来赔偿这场战争造成的所有损失。</p><p>要用俄罗斯资产进行赔偿，因为侵略者必须尽一切力量来恢复被其侵犯的正义。</p><p><br></p><p>我们已经向联合国大会提出了一项关于俄罗斯战争造成的损害的国际赔偿机制的决议，并得到了认可。</p><p>我们请求你们执行这项决议。</p><p><br></p><p>我们还在准备第二个决议——关于成立特别法庭。请加入并支持它。</p><p>因为世界上没有哪个民族不渴望正义。</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>第八，生态灭绝，需要立即保护环境。</strong></p><p><br></p><p>炮火烧毁了数百万公顷的森林。将近 20 万公顷的土地被未爆炸的地雷和炮弹污染。数十座煤矿被淹，包括1979年进行地下核试验爆炸的煤矿……这是顿涅茨克地区的“Yunkom”矿。它位于被俄罗斯占领的领土上,因为占领者的缘故已经被洪水淹没了好几年。莫斯科所有人都知道它不仅对顿涅茨克地区的河流、而且对黑海盆地构成了多大的威胁。只有解除对我们领土的占领才能为消除这一威胁提供条件。</p><p><br></p><p>无法准确计算出烧毁的油库和其他火灾造成的大气污染量……</p><p>还有炸毁的污水处理设施、烧毁的化工厂、无数被杀动物的乱葬坑。</p><p><br></p><p>想象一下——由于俄罗斯的侵略，600 万头家畜死亡。600万！这些是官方数字。</p><p>至少有5万只海豚在黑海遇难。</p><p>成千上万公顷的土壤被有害物质污染——其中大部分是肥沃的土壤。曾经是肥沃的土壤。</p><p><br></p><p>在上周于埃及举行的气候峰会上，我提议建立一个平台来评估战争对环境造成的破坏。我们必须执行这条建议。</p><p><br></p><p>我们还必须找到共同应对战争所造成的全部环境威胁的办法。</p><p>否则，就无法恢复正常、稳定的生活，战争的影响将长期存在——在水、土壤和空气被污染的环境中，地雷爆炸将夺去儿童和成人的生命。</p><p><br></p><p>我感谢所有已经在帮助我们排雷的国家。这些行动迫切需要更多的设备和专家。</p><p>水处理设施的修复也需要资金和技术。</p><p><br></p><p>这不仅仅是乌克兰的问题。这对全世界来说也是一项挑战。</p><p><br></p><p><strong>第九，防止局势恶化。</strong></p><p><br></p><p>在我们的安全得到妥善保障之前，这种风险仍然存在并将持续存在。</p><p><br></p><p>乌克兰不是任何联盟的成员。</p><p>而俄罗斯之所以能够发动这场战争，恰恰是因为乌克兰仍处于灰色地带——介于欧洲—大西洋世界和俄罗斯帝国主义之间。</p><p>现在我们也没有任何安全保证。那么，我们如何才能防止俄罗斯重演对我们的侵呢？</p><p><br></p><p>我们需要有效的安全保证。这就是为什么我们准备了一份协议草案——《基辅安全契约》，并已将其提交给合作伙伴们。</p><p><br></p><p>因此，我们应该召开一次国际会议，巩固战后欧洲-大西洋地区安全架构的关键要素，包括对乌克兰的保障。</p><p>会议的主要成果应该是签署《基辅安全契约》。</p><p><br></p><p>我们随时都能这样做——甚至就在今年。我们也必须这样做。</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>第十，对战争结束的确认。</strong></p><p><br></p><p>当所有的反战措施都实施完毕，当安全和正义开始恢复时，各方应该签署一份确认战争结束的文件。</p><p><br></p><p>我想强调的是，以上这些步骤都不会花费很长时间。一步最多一个月。对于某些步骤，几天就足够了。</p><p><br></p><p>我们已经在粮食出口计划方面取得了积极的经验。怎么取得成效的？</p><p>有联合国——以及协议的另外两个参与方：一方面是乌克兰、土耳其和联合国，另一方面是俄罗斯、土耳其和联合国。</p><p><br></p><p>我刚才提出的每个要点的实施都可以用类似的方式来解决。准备带头做出这个或那个决定的国家可以成为该协议的缔约方。</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>重复一遍：</p><p>辐射和核安全；食品安全；能源安全；释放所有囚犯和被驱逐者；执行联合国宪章和恢复乌克兰的领土完整和世界秩序；俄罗斯军队撤出并停止敌对行动；恢复正义；防止生态灭绝；防止局势恶化；最后 - 对战争结束的确认。</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>尊敬的各位领导人！</p><p><br></p><p>我已经罗列出你们每个人都可以为自己选择的道路——如何成为和平的共同创造者。</p><p><br></p><p>请选择你们的领导之路——我们一起一定能实施和平方案。</p><p><br></p><p>它会起到什么作用？</p><p>它将挽救成千上万的生命。</p><p>它将重塑国际法的有效性。</p><p>它将重振安全架构。</p><p>它将恢复全球稳定，否则整个世界都会受苦。</p><p>本质上——这就是世界上诚实的国家正在合作的目标。</p><p><br></p><p>和平是一种全球价值，对世界上每个人都很重要。我相信，对于你们每个人—19 国集团的领导人们，也是如此。</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>我已经概述了具体、实用的解决方案。它们可以被迅速地实施。他们是有效的。</p><p><br></p><p>如果俄罗斯反对我们的和平方案，你就会知道它只想要战争。</p><p><br></p><p>乌克兰感谢世界上所有帮助我们保护自由和恢复和平的人。</p><p><br></p><p>让我们的共同努力早日取得成功，并体现在这次峰会的成果中。</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>谢谢您的邀请！</p><p><br></p><p>荣耀归于乌克兰！</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Dear President Widodo!</strong></p><p><strong>Dear colleagues! The world’s majority, which stands with us!</strong></p><p>I address you in Ukrainian, but in front of each of you on the table you will find our proposals. In your language. In demonstration of respect for you.&nbsp;</p><p>I have just returned to our capital. Returned from the city of Kherson.</p><p>Kherson is one of the key cities in the south of our country and the only regional centre that Russia managed to occupy after February 24.</p><p>And now Kherson is already liberated.</p><p>What does it mean? For Ukraine, this liberation operation of our Defence Forces is reminiscent of many battles of the past, which became turning points in the wars of the past.</p><p>Those battles symbolized such changes, after which people already knew who will be victorious even though the ultimate victory still had to be fought for.</p><p>It is like, for example, D-Day - the landing of the Allies in Normandy. It was not yet a final point in the fight against evil, but it already determined the entire further course of events. This is exactly what we are feeling now.</p><p>Now - when Kherson is free.</p><p>To liberate our entire land from the Russists, we still will have to fight for a while longer... To fight! However, if the victory will be ours in any case, and we are sure of it, then shouldn't we try to implement our formula for peace to save thousands of lives and protect the world from further destabilizations?</p><p>That is why I want to present our vision of the path to peace - how to actually achieve it. And not only for us, but also for all of you, your allies and partners.</p><p>In my statement in September of this year at UN General Assembly, I presented Ukraine’s formula for peace. A formula of peace for the world.</p><p>Just when the world was hoping to recover from the blows of the pandemic, the Russian war provoked a whole series of new global challenges. This must be stopped!</p><p>There is a set of solutions that need to be implemented. And I want the conversation about it to be public, not behind the scenes. I want it to be discussed in specific terms, and not in broad strokes.</p><p>Maybe I'll go over the allotted time limit.</p><p>But the issue of peace is worth it.</p><p>I want this aggressive Russian war to end justly and on the basis of the UN Charter and international law. Not "somehow" - according to the apt formulation of the UN Secretary-General António Guterres.</p><p>Ukraine should not be offered to conclude compromises with its conscience, sovereignty, territory and independence. We respect the rules and we are people of our word.</p><p>Ukraine has always been a leader in peacekeeping efforts, and the world has witnessed it. And if Russia says that it supposedly wants to end this war, let it prove it with actions.</p><p>Apparently, one cannot trust Russia's words, and there will be no Minsks-3, which Russia would violate immediately after signing.</p><p>If there are no concrete actions to restore peace, it means that Russia simply wants to deceive all of you again, deceive the world and freeze the war just when its defeats have become particularly notable.</p><p>We will not allow Russia to wait it out, build up its forces, and then start a new series of terror and global destabilization.</p><p>I am convinced now is the time when the Russian destructive war must and can be stopped.</p><p>So, here are the proposals of Ukraine:</p><p><strong>The first is radiation and nuclear safety.</strong></p><p>No one has the right to blackmail the world with a radioactive disaster. This is an axiom.</p><p>However, in front of the eyes of the whole world, Russia has turned our Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant into a radioactive bomb that can explode at any moment. Where will the radiation cloud go? Perhaps towards the territory of the EU. Maybe to Türkiye. Maybe to the Middle East. I consider as criminal even a hypothetical possibility of such a scenario!</p><p>Radiation safety must be restored. The IAEA has already provided respective recommendations, confirming all the risks that we have repeatedly raised. Therefore, Russia must immediately withdraw all its militants from the territory of the Zaporizhzhia NPP. The station must be immediately transferred to the control of the IAEA and the Ukrainian personnel. The normal connection of the station to the power grid must be restored immediately so that nothing threatens the stability of the reactors.</p><p>We proposed that IAEA missions are sent to all Ukrainian nuclear plants - four of them, 15 nuclear units in total. Plus the Chornobyl plant, which has been shut down and is under conservation. Such missions can verify that any hostile activity against Ukrainian nuclear facilities has indeed ceased.</p><p>How long does it take to implement it? Russia can begin the demilitarization of the Zaporizhzhia NPP as early as tomorrow if it is really ready to restore the radioactive safety it violated.</p><p>The same goes for the crazy threats of nuclear weapons that Russian officials resort to. There are and cannot be any excuses for nuclear blackmail. And I thank you, dear G-19, for making this clear.</p><p>However, please use all your power to make Russia abandon nuclear threats. The basis for such efforts can be the Budapest Memorandum and respective capabilities of the signatory states.</p><p><strong>The second challenge is food security.</strong></p><p>Thanks to the strong participation of the UN, Türkiye and other partners, we have demonstrated how the cooperation of a few can restore food security for the many.</p><p>I believe our export grain initiative deserves an indefinite extension - no matter when the war ends.</p><p>The right to food is a fundamental right of every person in the world.</p><p>Since July, Ukraine has exported over 10 million tons of food by sea. We can increase exports by several million tons per month. Thus for this I propose to expand the grain export initiative to our other ports - in particular, to the ports of Mykolaiv and "Olvia" in the Mykolaiv region.</p><p>I also call on all countries – and in particular your countries, dear G-19 leaders – to join our initiative to help the poorest with food.</p><p>We have already launched the initiative – "Grain From Ukraine". And the first vessel - Nord Vind - leaves for Ethiopia with 27 thousand tons of wheat on board. This is the amount that can feed almost 100,000 people per year. There can be many such ships from Ukraine, and therefore there will be many people in poor countries who are saved from starvation.</p><p>Ukraine can export 45 million tons of food this year. And let a significant part of it be directed to those who suffer the most.</p><p>What do we propose exactly? Each country can join with a specific contribution and become a co-creator of the victory over hunger and the food crisis.</p><p><strong>The third is energy security.</strong></p><p>All of you can witness what the Russian terror is aimed at now. This is an attempt to turn the cold into a weapon. A weapon against millions of people.</p><p>About 40% of our energy infrastructure were destroyed by the strikes of Russian missiles and Iranian drones used by the occupiers. Every week, Russia blows up our power plants, transformers, and electricity supply lines.</p><p>A related goal of this terror is to prevent the export of our electricity to neighbouring countries, which could significantly help them stabilize the energy situation and reduce prices for consumers.</p><p>Russia is interested in the energy crisis. And we should all be interested in ending terror.</p><p>I thank all our partners who have already helped Ukraine with the supply of air defence and missile defence systems. This allows us to shoot down some of the Russian missiles and Iranian drones. But we must fully protect our sky. I ask you to increase respective assistance!</p><p>We have already proposed that a mission of UN experts is sent to the objects of critical energy infrastructure of Ukraine to assess the scope of damage and the needs for restoration, as well as to prevent their further destruction. We need to speed up the dispatch of this mission!</p><p>This will be a specific contribution of the international community to the stabilization of the energy situation in Ukraine and Europe, and therefore in the global energy market.</p><p>However, regardless of the decisions of the world, any day Russia on its own can simply abandon strikes on Ukrainian energy generation and water and heat supply facilities. Let Russia prove by its rejection of terror that it is really interested in the restoration of peace.</p><p>We must also take a fundamental step so that energy resources are no longer used as weapons. Price restrictions on Russian energy resources should be introduced.</p><p>If Russia is trying to deprive Ukraine, Europe and all energy consumers in the world of predictability and price stability, the answer to this should be a forced limitation of export prices for Russia. So that the export price was not higher than the production cost. That's fair. If you take something away, the world has the right to take from you.</p><p><strong>The fourth challenge is the release of all prisoners and deportees.</strong></p><p>Thousands of our people - military and civilians - are in the Russian captivity. They are subjected to brutal torture - this is mass abuse!</p><p>In addition, we know by name 11 thousand children who were forcibly deported to Russia. They are separated from their parents in full knowledge that they have families.&nbsp;</p><p>Apart from the children, whose data we know, there are tens of thousands of those who were forcibly deported and about whom we know only indirectly. Among them are many, whose parents were killed by Russian strikes, and now they are being held in the state that murdered them.</p><p>Add to that hundreds of thousands of deported adults, and you will see what a humanitarian catastrophe the Russian war has caused.</p><p>Add political prisoners - Ukrainian citizens who are held in Russia and in the temporarily occupied territory, in particular in Crimea.</p><p>We must release all these people!</p><p>I want to point out that we did not find support from the International Committee of the Red Cross. We do not see that they are fully fighting to gain access to the camps, where Ukrainian prisoners of war and political prisoners are held. Neither they are helping to find deported Ukrainians. This self-withdrawal is the self-destruction of the Red Cross as an organization that was once respected.</p><p>We cannot wait.</p><p>Therefore, we must unite for the sake of the only realistic model of the release of prisoners - "all for all".</p><p>And also for the release of all children and adults who were deported to Russia.</p><p>I thank the partners for their efforts, which allowed the release of many Ukrainians and foreign citizens, who were captured by the Russians. And let your leadership and the sincere heart of other leaders, who are present now, help free other Ukrainians as well.</p><p><strong>The fifth – implementation of the UN Charter and restoration of Ukraine’s territorial integrity and the world order.</strong></p><p>Article 2 of the UN Charter defines everything very clearly. Everything that Russia violated by this war.</p><p>Therefore, we must restore the validity of international law - and without any compromises with the aggressor. Because the UN Charter cannot be applied partially, selectively or "at will".</p><p>Russia must reaffirm the territorial integrity of Ukraine within the framework of the relevant resolutions of the UN General Assembly and the applicable international legally binding documents.</p><p>It is not up to negotiations.</p><p><strong>The sixth challenge is withdrawal of Russian troops and cessation of hostilities.</strong></p><p>There is a clear understanding of how to achieve this.</p><p>Russia must withdraw all its troops and armed formations from the territory of Ukraine. Ukraine's control over all sections of our state border with Russia must be restored.</p><p>This will result in a real and complete cessation of hostilities.</p><p>Every day of delay means new deaths of Ukrainians, new threats to the world, and an insane increase in losses due to continuation of the Russian aggression – losses for everyone in the world.</p><p><strong>The seventh – justice.</strong></p><p>This is what stokes the greatest emotions.</p><p>Everywhere, when we liberate our land, we see one thing - Russia leaves behind torture chambers and mass burials of murdered people.</p><p>This was the case in Bucha and other cities in the north of the country after the occupation. This was the case in the Kharkiv region. The same we observe now in the Kherson region.</p><p>As of today, we have a full information about four hundred and thirty children killed by Russian strikes. Only children! And only those about whom we know everything for sure.</p><p>And how many mass graves are there in the territory that still remains under the control of Russia? What will we see in Mariupol?</p><p>That is why the world should endorse establishment of the Special Tribunal regarding the crime of Russia’s aggression against Ukraine and the creation of an international mechanism to compensate for all the damages caused by this war. Compensation at the expense of Russian assets, because it is the aggressor who must do everything to restore the justice violated by it.</p><p>We have already proposed a resolution of the UN General Assembly regarding an international compensation mechanism for damages caused by the Russian war. It is endorsed. We ask you to implement it.</p><p>We are also preparing the second resolution - on the Special Tribunal. Please join and support it.</p><p>Because there is no such nation in the world that does not appreciate justice.</p><p><strong>The eighth challenge is ecocide, the need for immediate protection of environment.</strong></p><p>Millions of hectares of forest were burned by shelling. Almost two hundred thousand hectares of our land are contaminated with unexploded mines and shells. Dozens of coal mines are flooded, including the mine in which an underground nuclear test explosion was carried out in 1979...</p><p>This is the “Yunkom” mine in the Donetsk region. It is located on the territory occupied by Russia. It has been flooded for several years - precisely because of the occupiers. Everyone in Moscow knows what a threat it poses not only to the rivers in the Donetsk region, but also to the Black Sea basin. Only the de-occupation of our territory can provide the conditions for the elimination of this threat.</p><p>It is impossible to accurately calculate the amount of atmospheric pollution from burnt oil depots and other fires... As well as from blown up sewage facilities, burned chemical plants, innumerable burial sites of slayed animals.</p><p>Just imagine this – due to the Russian aggression, 6 million domestic animals died. 6 million! These are official numbers. At least 50,000 dolphins were killed in the Black Sea. Thousands of hectares of soil are contaminated with harmful substances - most of them are fertile soils. Were fertile soils.</p><p>During the last week’s Climate Summit in Egypt, I proposed a platform to assess the environmental damage of war. We have to implement it.</p><p>We must also find common responses to all environmental threats created by the war. Without this, there will be no return to a normal, stable life, and the reverberations of the war will remain for a long time - in the explosions of mines that will take the lives of children and adults, in the pollution of water, soil and atmosphere.</p><p>I thank all the countries that are already helping us with demining. There is an urgent need for an increased number of equipment and experts for these operations.</p><p>Funds and technologies are also needed for the restoration of water treatment facilities.</p><p>This is not just a Ukrainian problem. This is a challenge for the whole world.</p><p><strong>The next - the ninth – is the prevention of escalation.</strong></p><p>A risk that still exists and will remain until our security is properly ensured.</p><p>Ukraine is not a member of any of the alliances. And Russia was able to start this war precisely because Ukraine remained in the grey zone - between the Euro-Atlantic world and the Russian imperialism. Now we do not have any security assurances either. So, how can we prevent repetition of Russia’s such aggression against us?</p><p>We need effective security assurances. That is why we prepared a draft agreement – the Kyiv Security Compact, and have already presented it to partners.</p><p>Thus, we should hold an international conference to cement the key elements of the post-war security architecture in the Euro-Atlantic space, including guarantees for Ukraine.</p><p>The main outcome of the conference should be the signing of the Kyiv Security Compact.</p><p>We can do it any time - even this year. And we must do it.</p><p><strong>And the tenth – confirmation of the end of the war.</strong></p><p>When all the antiwar measures are implemented, when security and justice begin to be restored, a document confirming the end of the war should be signed by the parties.</p><p>I would like to emphasize that none of the steps above can take long. A month for one step at the most. For some steps, a couple of days are enough.</p><p>We already have a positive experience with the grain export initiative. How does it work?</p><p>There is the UN - and two other parties to the agreements: on one side Ukraine, Türkiye and the UN, and on the other side Russia, Türkiye and the UN.</p><p>Implementation of each of the points I have just presented can be worked out in a similar fashion. States ready to take the lead in this or that decision can become parties to the arrangement.&nbsp;</p><p>Once again:</p><p>radiation and nuclear safety; food security; energy security; release of all prisoners and deported persons; implementation of the UN Charter and restoration of Ukraine’s territorial integrity and the world order; withdrawal of Russian troops and cessation of hostilities; restoration of justice; countering ecocide; preventing escalation; and finally - confirmation of the end of the war.</p><p><strong>Dear leaders!</strong></p><p>I have outlined the paths each of you can choose for yourself - how to become a co-creator of peace.</p><p>Please choose your path for leadership - and together we will surely implement the peace formula.</p><p>What will it do?</p><p>It will save thousands of lives. It will restore the validity of international law. It will revitalize the security architecture. It will return the global stability, without which the whole world is suffering. In essence – this is what the honest countries of the world are cooperating for.</p><p>Peace is a global value. That, which is important for every person in the world.&nbsp;</p><p>I am confident that it is likewise for each of you, leaders of G-19.</p><p>I have outlined specific, practical solutions. They can be implemented. Quickly. They are effective.</p><p>And if Russia opposes our peace formula, you will see that it only wants war.</p><p>Ukraine is grateful to everyone in the world who helps us to protect freedom and to restore peace.</p><p>Let our joint efforts be crowned with success as soon as possible and be reflected in the outcomes of this summit.</p><p><strong>Thank you for the invitation!</strong></p><p><strong>Glory to Ukraine!</strong></p>
