<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March 27, Ma Ying-jeou, the former leader of the Taiwan region (former president of the Republic of China) arrived in Nanjing and started his visit to mainland China in the name of "worshiping ancestors". Ma Ying-jeou is the first outgoing president of Taiwan to visit the mainland, which has extraordinary symbolic significance, which has aroused widespread attention from the international community and heated disputes among all parties.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent months, with the continuation of the Russia-Ukraine war and the formation and confrontation of the two camps in the world (the free and democratic camp that supports Ukraine and the authoritarian camp that is pro-Russian), the situation in the Taiwan Strait has also become increasingly heated. With regard to the possibility of China's military attack on Taiwan, public opinion has been heated up. The United States, Japan and Europe have also intervened in the Taiwan issue in various ways, and the situation in the Taiwan Strait has become increasingly tense.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under such circumstances, Ma Ying-jeou led a delegation of many young students to visit the mainland, which caused even more controversy.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Taiwan, since anti-communist and anti-mainland sentiments have dominated public opinion in recent years, most Taiwanese are naturally critical of Ma Ying-jeou's visit. They believe that under the current situation of high confrontation between the two sides of the strait, Ma Ying-jeou's visit to the mainland is an act of "traitorism" and "surrender", which has damaged the morale of the Taiwanese "resistance to China and protection of Taiwan". Some commentators also believe that Ma Ying-jeou's visit is tantamount to giving the CCP a "gift for the United Front", which will be used and flaunted by the CCP as a tool to further infiltrate Taiwan and eventually invade Taiwan. There are also some commentators who are quite personal and attacking, believing that Ma Ying-jeou is out of greed for fame and fortune, to get "rewards" from the CCP, and to pave the way for Taiwan to get an official position under the CCP's rule after the fall of Taiwan.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, there are also voices of understanding and appreciation for Ma Ying-jeou's visit to China, but they are relatively few, and they mainly come from Chinese officials and some people in the West. Only some members of the Kuomintang on the island expressed support for the former president and former party chairman. On the whole, it is clear that the voice of criticism is louder than praise. Among the political opponents in China, almost one-sidedly criticized Ma Ying-jeou's visit to China.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The author, who is also a political opponent, has a relatively different evaluation, and holds a quite positive view on Ma Ying-jeou's visit to China.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All along, the author has a good impression of Mr. Ma Ying-jeou. This is not only because Ma Ying-jeou's political stance agrees with the author's, but also because Mr. Ma's personality and morality are worthy of respect.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ma Ying-jeou is one of the few in Taiwan's political arena after the 1990sHas a strong Chinese national identity and is full of national emotions, A political figure who truly cares about mainland China and its people, and has deep expectations for the country's democratic reunification. During Ma Ying-jeou's administration, the "cross-strait family" was implemented in the economic, cultural, and social fields, and the exchanges between the people of the two sides of the strait were also unprecedentedly close and friendly. Although the two sides are still at odds politically, they can basically "shelve disputes and seek common development." The level of peace in the Taiwan Strait and the level of cross-strait cooperation reached a historical peak during the Ma Ying-jeou era.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ma Ying-jeou is also very concerned about human rights, culture and education, and people's livelihood in the mainland. Mr. Ma Ying-jeou will publish articles/posts on the anniversary of the June 4 incident every year to express his condolences to the students and people who died in the June 4 incident in 1989, and to emphasize the necessity and importance of China's democratization. Ma Ying-jeou also attaches great importance to the education and growth of the Chinese youth generation and the exchanges and interactions between young people on both sides of the Strait. During his administration, he introduced various policies to facilitate mainland students to study in Taiwan, and promoted the cooperation between Taiwan's educational institutions and the mainland. This has contributed a lot to the mutual understanding of the people on both sides of the strait, especially the young people, and the harmony and friendship of the next generation of mainland and Taiwan people.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During Ma Ying-jeou's tenure as president, he also issued a commendation order to Chinese female writer Zhang Chunru, praising her for writing the book "The Rape of Nanking" with her life and arousing the world's attention and understanding of the Nanjing Massacre. This also reflects Ma Ying-jeou's love for the Chinese nation, his concern for the tragic history that happened in the mainland, and his praise and remembrance of those who have contributed to the Chinese nation within his ability.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Ma Ying-jeou has been active in Taiwan for decades, whether he was the secretary of Chiang Ching-kuo, later became the president, or as a commoner after he stepped down as a leader, he has maintained excellent moral character and noble personality. Compared with other scandal-prone politicians in Taiwan, Ma Ying-jeou is one of the few politicians who has almost no stains. He is honest, honest, approachable, and elegant in speech.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, Mr. Ma Ying-jeou is a person who sincerely loves the Chinese nation, sincerely hopes for the democratic unity of China, and has a noble personal moral character. Such a person, of course, would not sell himself or bow down to serve others for the sake of some fame and fortune.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why Ma Ying-jeou chose to visit the mainland at this time is that he hopes to do his best to promote peace and exchanges between the two sides of the strait, reduce unnecessary hostility and miscalculation, and resolve another Taiwan Strait crisis.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before this visit to the mainland, Ma Ying-jeou repeatedly reminded the Tsai Ing-wen government not to intensify the conflict with the mainland as much as possible. However, in the context of tense relations across the Taiwan Strait and the DPP government's firm policy of "resisting China and protecting Taiwan", Ma Ying-jeou's appeal has little effect. But Ma Ying-jeou still did not give up calling for peace. And this visit to Lu was also his decision after careful consideration.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the first former leader of Taiwan to visit the mainland, it is of extraordinary significance and deserves a high-level grand reception. However, after Ma Ying-jeou arrived in Nanjing on the 27th, he was only greeted by the deputy director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council. The welcome ceremony was also very simple, which showed that the Chinese mainland was not very enthusiastic about Ma Ying-jeou's visit. This also reflects the embarrassment of Ma Ying-jeou's "don't please". And this should have been predicted by Ma Ying-jeou before his visit to China.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even so, Ma Ying-jeou resolutely embarked on a trip to the mainland, which further proved his sincerity of not caring about gain or loss of fame and fortune, and devoted himself to promoting peace and exchanges between the two sides of the strait. And this time he led dozens of young students to the mainland, which also reflects his consistent attitude of attaching importance to education, cultivating new talents, and promoting cross-strait youth exchanges.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although, under the current Taiwan Strait and international situation, as well as the relatively unfavorable political climate on both sides of the Strait, Ma Ying-jeou's visit is difficult to change the reality, and its effect is very limited. But this also makes Ma Ying-jeou's visit even more rare and valuable, reflecting that in today's sinister cross-strait and international situation, there are still some people who are trying to promote communication and relaxation and cool down the situation. This is not easy, but worthy of respect and cherish.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a writer born in mainland China, the author, like Mr. Ma Ying-jeou, supports cross-strait reunification on the basis of democracy. Of course, no matter what the system is, national reunification must respect the will of the majority of people on both sides of the strait, and should not be reunified by force. If a war breaks out in the Taiwan Strait, people will die, and it is unnecessary.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authorities in power in Taiwan today insist on freedom and democracy,don't care about the mainlandpeople, and have no intention of promoting thedemocratization, only hope to keepTaiwan, Penghu, Jinmastatus quo. This is a narrow position. Moreover, if the mainland is still under the dictatorship of the CCP and the people are brainwashed and manipulated, it is impossible for the Taiwan Strait to be truly peaceful. A free and democratic Taiwan will always faceAuthoritarian CCP Chinathreaten.Therefore, onlyMainland China has also realized democracy, and the systems on both sides of the Taiwan Strait are the same, and both follow universal values, so peace will be real and lasting.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The author hopes that there will be more people in Taiwan who, like Mr. Ma Ying-jeou, firmly believe in the universal values ​​of freedom and democracy on the one hand, and on the other hand care about the compatriots on the mainland and care about the more than 9 million square kilometers that the Republic of China still has in name. The hardships of more than one billion people in the territory, and strive to promote the democratization and political pluralism of the whole of China, and realize the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, peace in the Asia-Pacific, and prosperity in the world.</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
