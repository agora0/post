<p>Five years after we were founded, we say goodbye to readers with a heavy heart.</p>
<p>Flashed back to the New Year&rsquo;s Day in 2017. Against the backdrop of growing worries about Hong Kong&rsquo;s press freedom, some of our founders, who are veteran journalists, held a press conference to launch our online media platform. We hoped CitizenNews could live up to the spirit of professionalism, to report the news in the way we have always aspired to, and more importantly to serve the public and greater public good.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By taking a small step, we hope we could inspire everyone in the industry to take a small step. Taken together, it will become a big step in protecting press freedom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although our manpower and resources were limited, we found a small path after having taken one small step day after day. Our small newsroom has grown into a team with dozens of reporters covering what matters to Hong Kong: exclusive stories, data news, interviews, opinion articles, court stories, China news, and features stories on latest programme In Voices Strong. From little known to general readers, we are pleased to hear comments from you &ldquo;we have watched your news and daily show&rdquo;.</p>
<p>We may not be the fastest or the most productive outlets in town, but our team, with veterans and young journalists, stand united to publish truthful news reporting with depth.</p>
<p>Five years on, we say thank you to everyone of you.</p>
<p>In the first article published on CitizenNews on January 1, 2017, it reads: &ldquo;CitizenNews is born on this special first day of 2017. Because no matter what, we hoped in the days to come, you will join us and sing along &lsquo;We all deeply love this place. Let&rsquo;s all remember, happy or sad, alive or dead, this is Hong Kong.&rsquo;</p>
<p>We all love this place, deeply. Regrettably, what was ahead of us is not just pouring rains or blowing winds, but hurricanes and tsunamis.</p>
<p>We have never forgotten our original intent. Sadly, we can no longer strive to turn our beliefs into reality without fear because of the sea change in the society over the past two years and the deteriorating media environment.</p>
<p>At the centre of a brewing storm, we found ourself in a critical situation. In the face of a crisis, we must ensure the safety and well-being of everyone who are on board.</p>
<p>We announced with a heavy heart that CitizenNews will cease operation starting from January 4, 2022 (Tuesday). Our website will stop updates and will shut down later.</p>
<p>To our subscribers and readers, we sincerely thank you for your support. We shall always remember your unwavering love.</p>
<p>We shall always treasure this incredible journey in the past five years.</p>
