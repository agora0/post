    <figcaption><span>@lessons_from_books</span></figcaption></figure><p>“Love is such a horrible thing…” said Alivia. “That’s not true. Love can be so many thing but is never horrible or stupid.” Joshua expressed while his fingers caressed her hair. “Otherwise, that’s not love.”</p><p>This cute pocket book ‘Under Her Cursed Scythe’ from Jolly Molly Wong (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/j.m.wong/" target="_blank">@j.m.wong</a>) is a fantasy novel that tells the story of a town girl named Alivia, who is cursed to become a merciless killer at night. When she unexpectedly encounters the Blessers, she begins to doubt her decisions of killing, and soon discovers the dark secrets behind her witchy family.</p><p>‘Under Her Cursed Scythe’ is a story about fears, growth and love. You will witness Alivia struggling to accept the pain she grows up with while trying to defy the orders from the demon. If you love Harry Potter, this book will definitely remind you of the magical journey you went through reading that series. There’re so many unexplored parts of the fantasy world Jolly has created and I wish to see more visions coming from her in the sequel.</p><p>I imagine this book would be perfect to be turned into a play, as the scenes and settings are organised in a very linear way. It’d be amazing if students could enjoy the fun of reading this work and performing the story on stage!</p><p>Cheers to all the Hong Kong authors out there like Jolly who still put their faith in writing and work hard to show us that creativity is never lost in this urban jungle.</p><p>📖 Under Her Cursed Scythe - <a href="https://www.instagram.com/j.m.wong/" target="_blank">@j.m.wong</a></p><p>You can order the non-pocket size version & Kindle version on Book Depository and Amazon. If you’d love to get the pocket version, you can DM the author <a href="https://www.instagram.com/j.m.wong/" target="_blank">@j.m.wong</a> directly!</p><p>謝謝你們讀到這裡，中文內容會很快回歸！</p><p>喜歡我的分享嗎？歡迎在Matters、IG和Potato Media上追蹤我!<br class="smart">Matters: <a href="https://matters.news/@lessonsfromb" target="_blank">https://matters.news/@lessonsfromb</a><br class="smart">IG: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lessons_from_books/" target="_blank">https://www.instagram.com/lessons_from_books/</a><br class="smart">Potato Media: <a href="https://www.potatomedia.co/signup?invite=lL1wy3BZB" target="_blank">https://www.potatomedia.co/signup?invite=lL1wy3BZB </a></p>
