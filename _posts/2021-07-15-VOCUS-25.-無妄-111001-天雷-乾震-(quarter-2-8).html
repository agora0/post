<p><strong>元亨利貞，其匪正有眚，不利有攸往。--</strong> 大晴天的時候竟然聽見雷鳴聲，這是很不尋常的現象啊！此時，你的元神意識可能會興致高昂、非常敏銳的想去偵察究竟是怎麼回事。那個傳來特別強烈訊息的區域是不是正在發生什麼非常明顯、難以忽視的事情呢？為了安全起見，是不是不要輕舉妄動比較好呢？<strong>(P.S.此處「匪」字解為「非常區域」或「感官刺激的訊息特別強烈的區域」。「眚」解為「醒目」、「看清楚」或「再三省視」、「避免忽視」。)</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>初九：無妄，往吉。/</strong> <strong>變卦天地否 --</strong> 不尋常的現象，通常超出了以往可以預期的判斷。聽到不可置信的事情，剛開始通常是目瞪口呆、有口無言，不知該作如何解釋，甚至以為自己還在睡夢中。其實，何必過度擔憂、何必過度妄想呢？此時還不如出去看看吧！雖然待在自己熟悉的小天地裡感到安穩和習慣，但是外面廣大的自然界中有多少不曾結識的事物呢？<br>
<br>
<strong>六二：不耕獲，不菑畬，則利有攸往？ / 變卦天澤履 --</strong> 不耕作卻能得到收獲、不經營卻能擁有田產，按照這樣不尋常的例子，只要有利可圖的事情都可以趕快去做了，那裡還需要根據什麼道理和方法、程序和步驟呢？然而，我們曾經從大自然裡發現的道理，難道不會因為大自然的變化而有所改變嗎？<br>
<br>
<strong>六三：無妄之災，或系之牛。行人之得，邑人之災。/ 變卦天火同人 --</strong> 預料之外的災難，往往使人內心充滿疑惑，有時候甚至流言滿天飛，說什麼地牛翻身、雷鳥吐火的關係等等，把災難發生的原因牽連到無辜的野牛或珍禽身上。實際行動的人親身經歷所得到的見聞，有時候以訛傳訛的，竟然被部份人士異口同聲的轉述為神秘詭異的災難呢<strong>！(P.S. 此處「邑」解為「部份」、some part、part of 。)</strong><br>
<br>
<strong>九四：可貞，無咎。/ 變卦風雷益 --</strong> 風急降則草木匍匐、雷聲響則氣流波動，就算是預料之外的自然現象，也是可能偵測出原因的，這有什麼好奇怪的呢？只要收集相關線索、讓資料不斷增加壘積，最後總有真相大白的一天啊！問題是，此時有沒有容量足夠的資料庫可以儲存大量增加的資料呢？<br>
<br>
<strong>九五：無妄之疾，勿藥，有喜。/ 變卦火雷噬嗑 --</strong> 對於預料之外的疾病，也就是那些不曾記錄在病例中的疾病，似乎暫時是沒有藥物可以醫治的。此時，不如讓病人放鬆心情、快慰歡喜、滿足他們適合的志趣，以便讓他們發揮自己身體的自癒能力或免疫能力。<br>
<br>
<strong>上九：無妄，行有眚，無攸利。/ 變卦澤雷隨 --</strong> 在發生預料之外的狀況時，由於沒有實際經驗作為行動的參考實例，有可能忽視了應該注意的事項，導致無法順利進行處理。也就是說，預料之外的狀況是一種過去累積的經驗與目前發生的現象不能即時同步的狀況。<strong>(P.S.  此處「眚」解為「醒目」、「看清楚」或「再三省視」、「避免忽視」。）</strong><br>

"When you saw a woman carrying a big basket on the way near to market, you might suppose she was just going shopping or wandering around street mall. But this ancient Hanese pictogram word put the basket on the head of a symbol of woman, seemed like to emphasize the plenty mental space in a woman's thoughts and wishes."<br>
<br>
"Actually female might more worry about the real life, because they might get pregnant and consider to feed and raise the newborn baby before they falling in love with a male. So, if a man thought a woman's basket will always empty or carry nothing, even thought woman didn't think anything else except love, that is delusion, and that's why this word '妄' was a little similar to the English word 'worry', because of 'worry' involved 'wo' which was also a part of 'woman', just like this Hanese word '妄' involved a symbol '女' which meant 'woman'."</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>"And when you worry too much, you might prepare and carry too many things in your basket, even need a big cart."<br>
<br>
"Have you ever worried about the future? Sometimes the in-normal information might naturally attract our eyes and turn our head to look, even stimulate our consciousnesses to consider the relative changes might be coming into our lives."<br>
<br>
"Yes! Too much worry is not guilty! As you hear the loud thunder, big rain might be coming soon. But how about the strange thunder under the shining sun in the daytime, is it the sound of exploding coming from a volcano or a bomb? Or rushing damaging event in a traffic way? You might worry about the unclear dangerous crisis might change the existing peaceful life."<br>
<br>
"Maybe it was the falling meteor just rushing to some place on earth and making loud exploding sound. The original author of 易經 did not tell us what is it, but from the combined factors of this qua, something seemed like have been come from the sky and sound through the air in a long distance."<br>
<br>
"What we judge might be based on believable experiences, but something in-normal and out of our minds might cause the anxious situation and over worried imagination, even the rash or ridiculous thinking of suspicion and superstition."<br>
<br>
"I think...... As a journalist and translator, the original author of 易經 mustn't only stay indoors and make the daydreams, he might go outside to collect and note down the evidences about every unusual or incredible events, and try efforts to find the finest reasons of the incidences."<br>
<br>
"Some words in this qua even emphasized to find the natural law and the principle which related with each existing phenomenon, and had better to refute the rumors before getting the truth." <br>
<br>
"The exact reason about some diseases might be still ignored by medical research, before the safe treatment was found, those ancient medical doctors might suggest patients to keep their life relaxing with happiness and had better to do something preferable or comfortable, because of the healthy immunity of the selves body was just the major curing power."<br>
<br>
"Something out of mind might delay our judgements and decisions, but from the opinions written by the original author of 易經, there was nothing without reason, it was just a question about time. If we got sufficient information, everything in the nature could be explained."<br>
<br>
"Finally, they tried to collect and store more and more information about the great nature, planned to build a great specific database bigger than ever for reducing the confusion and frustration in their minds step by step, included various supernatural phenomena and incredible events."<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>雖然由實際經驗所建立的案例是處理事情時可靠的依據，但是卻不能用來解釋和處理那些沒有前例的狀況。更何況，有些預料之外的案例往往被當作發現機率很低的特例而遭到忽視，不但被拚除在正常狀況之外，甚至被視為怪異或奇蹟的超自然事件。換句話說，如果要正視那些特例的存在，不再大驚小怪的把它們視為異常現象，就得提昇自我的視野，把收集自然現象和實証資訊的範圍加以擴大。</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
"That's why the next qua was going to talk about the great specific storage for sharing or touring, seemed like to build the public library, museum, national biological park or natural wild zoo....... That must be the great architectural businesses created by the compassionate and rational society."<br>
<br>

<strong>I had stayed at here for a long time since I walked down from the mountain and met Mermaid E. beside the seashore. I exchanged my knowledge with her and tried to get the unknown parts about the 易經 which might have ever sunk in the deep sea very long time ago in history.</strong><br>
<br>
<strong>Sometimes the thunder sounded loudly above the sea and the incidental amazing tornados looked like giant spiral water-columns. What I thought about the peaceful beach sometimes might become unquietly horrible scenery.</strong><br>
<br>
<strong>Then I had a wonderful dream: To build a boat and take Mermaid E. with me sail to an unknown shore through the peaceful sea waves, to find a new fresh land after finishing the decoding work of the mysterious Hanese ancient scripture - 易經 which was usually known as I-Ching or The Book Of Change in English, but I more like to call it The I.E. Scripture.</strong><br>
<br>
<strong>Of course I knew Mermaid E. didn't need any boat, she could freely swim and deep dive by herself or ride the smart big turtle in the ocean, all I dreamed about was just belong to a personalized thinking way.</strong><br>
<br>
<strong>If "over worry" was related to "妄", then how about "over wonder"? ...... I hid my dream in my mind and didn't tell her a little, because I had better to show her the wonderful reality as I making my dream boat come true.</strong><br>
