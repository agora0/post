<p><strong>棟撓。利有攸往，亨。--</strong> 所謂太過份，就像建築的骨幹或柱子因為份量不夠、承擔不起過度的荷重而發生撓曲偏折的現象，柱子要能輕鬆支撐它負荷的重量纔行得通啊！<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>初六：藉用白茅，無咎。/</strong> <strong>變卦澤天夬 --</strong> 憑藉著類似白茅製成的草繩般堅韌的物質和地基來綑紮固定柱子、箍緊它的垂直結構，防止它發生撓曲、變形、位移，這樣是不錯的。當撓曲的現象太過度時，柱子可能會突然像人體發生骨折一樣的決裂而折斷呢！<strong>(P.S. 此處「白茅」也可能有 big base、basepole、basement 等與「基礎」、「基軸」、「地錨」、「地基」、「地基結構門類」等直接相關的含意。)</strong><br>
<br>
<strong>九二：枯楊生稊，老夫得其女妻，無不利。/ 變卦澤山咸 --</strong> 高大、密實、挺直的楊木通常是作為承重柱的好材料。它不但耐乾旱，在看起來好像枯朽的壯態下也能生出嫩芽枝葉，是所謂的千年不壞之木。就像成熟老練的丈夫總是得到妻女的依靠和信賴，只要有骨氣、以感情和誠意相待，沒有做不到的事啊！<br>
<br>
<strong>九三：棟撓，凶。/ 變卦澤水困 --</strong> 柱子因為承擔不起過度的荷重而發生撓曲，這當然是很危險的。此時，應該在柱子和柱子之間用密實材料做成框架結構或桁架結構去作紮實的補強，做好綑紮結構與防水防潮的加強工作，避免柱子承受過度的荷重。<br>
<br>
<strong>九四：棟隆，吉，有它吝。/ 變卦水風井 --</strong> 柱子做的隆重一點總是好事，結實的結構可以避免其它可能增加的、難以預測的額外荷重所引起的負擔，例如：水流或風動引起的側向推力。如果能設置柱井或柱礎作為加強固定柱子底部的基礎，並且做好排水管道以防範柱子底部潮濕腐壞，那麼就更好了！<br>
<br>
<strong>九五：枯楊生華，老婦得其士夫，無咎無譽。/ 變卦雷風恆 --</strong> 高大、密實、挺直的楊木通常是作為承重柱的好材料。它不但耐乾旱，在看起來好像枯朽的壯態下也能生長出叢叢花朵，是所謂千年不壞之木。就像成熟老練的婦人總是能得到男士或丈夫的矚目和睛睬，只要持之以恆的保養、照顧自己的骨本，那又何必感到意外和羨慕呢！<br>
<br>
<strong>上六：過涉滅頂，凶，無咎。/ 變卦天風姤 --</strong> 如同在過深的河流中涉水，可以感受到水流的衝擊力，如果要避免柱子高處承受過大的風力，就必須把房屋頂部的迎風面積逐層減少，形成傾斜狀或階梯狀的樣式，或是採用縷空通風的方法，以免屋頂發生結構破壞的危險，這樣是不錯的。<br>

"Actually, this Hanese word '過' had a meaning of unduly moving of the bone or fracture, it seemed like trying to describe the dangerous situation about some kind of overloading in architectural structure by these two simple symbols -- 'bone - 咼' and 'moving foot - 辵 or 辶'."<br>
<br>
"I think it also directly meant 'go too far', because of '過' was sounded like 'guò' in modern Chinese, and related to the over big span or over large bay in architectural structure. And we can see many words in this qua were talking about the deformation which was caused by the overloading or extra-force in architectural structure."<br>
<br>
"Do you feel the image of this qua '011110' looked like a column or beam with two joints on its both sides?"<br>
<br>
"Sure! Actually, most of the bones in the body have the same structural feature, that's why this qua was related to the bones and focused the issue on the structure of building."<br>
<br>
"Yes! Structure is the basic support of the building, just like the bones in our bodies, that's why 'base' is a little related to 'bones' in English. A stable building is always constructed with a good basement. This important principle was noted in the first yao of this qua."<br>
<br>
"Then...... how to fasten the structure tightly with hoops? How to choose good materials for construction? How to construct stronger structure? How to support heavy weight and resist wind power by suitable columns and sloping roof or else?....... There were some suggestions recorded in the following lyrics of this qua."<br>
<br>
"Actually, this Hanese word '過' not only meant but also sounded like 'collapse', its pictogram seemed like present the situation of the broken bone, a bone was broken and became two sections with some overlap, that's why 'collapse' also involved 'lap', just like to describe the situation when a column was broken....."<br>
<br>
"From the symbol of this qua '011110', a good bone is not only dense and homogeneous, but also needs two soft and flexible sides to adapt to the possible moving force as the buffers."<br>
<br>
"In wooden structure building, traditional architects in Hanese culture seemed like prefer to design the joints between column and beam without nails, but using a hinge-system...... Such concept was really matched with the symbol of '011110'."<br>
<br>
"Actually, the bird's skeleton is not so heavy and dense, indeed many little holes well-distribute inside their bones, that's why they can easily fly. If we looked the natural phenomena in detail, we might find more saving material way to construct the suitable structures."<br>
<br>
"As a matter of fact, the truss system and space-frame system structure were developed later in architectural history, and let the creation of super large-span space come true, even the speedy transports and airplanes."</p>
<p><br>
<strong>過份與不過份的差別，只是對於自然現象認識程度的不同，以及對於架構形式考慮程度的不同而已。如果詳細考究的話，其實自然物質的表面和內裡可能處處都有坑坑洞洞的空間，人為設計的物品也可能處處都有坎坎坷坷的缺陷、處處都有思考不夠仔細、不夠周全的問題啊！那麼，如何纔能避免思考的欠缺、行動的遺憾呢？</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
"When the destined point was far away from the starting point, sometimes we might hope to jump across a long distance and arrived at there in a short time...... But, we might ignore many details between these two points."<br>
<br>
"After walking step by step to practice, the truthful reality might be not as same as we thought, that's why the next qua '坎' was marked as '010010', a big span as '011110' was going to have some interruptions, it might be caused by the examination of critical lapses......"<br>
<br>
"Think about your own growing, when you are a very little kid, before jumping and running, have you ever tried effort to crawl and sit, stand and walk?...... Before standing up on the floor and ground, you might have some hesitation, you might start to ignore your tiny little friends in your childhood -- ants, they still busily crawled on the floor and ground, and you just worried that they might be trampled by your steps,...... but something made you feel proud and courageous might divert your attention......"<br>
<br>
"But how to prevent such kind of ignorance? Too many hesitations might make me interrupt and slower my walking steps, cause my each step become a difficult observation and careful decision...... I think fishes have not such moral questions, they live in water, not on the ground......"<br>
<br>
"This is a good question, but where is the answer?...... Actually, as you are talking about this question, you indeed not forget your little friends in your childhood, they still live in your subconsciousness, and someday you might solve this question......"<br>
<br>
"Can we talk with ants? Or just move to higher level floors? But ants still follow our moves and live with us everywhere...... Why they aren't afraid of us?......."<br>
<br>
"That maybe just like the question about traffic incidence. If you were a giant and ignored the traffic rules, you might harm many lives, but what were the traffic rules of great nature?....... A small planet might rush to the earth and cause many lives disappear, was there any traffic rule in the universe?......"<br>
<br>
"Last night I dreamed about a goat bite my left hand, and a very big dinosaurian egg is going to born out from a wall of rammed earth covered by grasses in a park......Goat is a kind of '羊' in Hanese, and my hand belongs to '我' in Hanese, then '羊' combines with '我' is '義' which seems like 'defined meaning'......Why ant was written as '蟻' in Hanese? I think maybe there is a special meaning between human and ant. Ants might anticipate the development of humankind's civilization......"<br>
<br>
"Maybe,......Rome was not built in one day, but the first step might be paced by ants, they are the pioneers on the ground, also the decomposers after the collapse of a life...... And, how about that dinosaurian egg in your dream? Is there some kind of special meaning?"<br>
<br>
"Dinosaurian bones are hard to be decomposed by ants, that's why those biological archeologists could dig out a lot of their skeletons buried under the grounds, they were the most lively and firmly solid skeletons on the earth before and after the collapse of their blooming times........."<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>What I confused was...... what's the difference between ants and dinosaurs? After their lives collapsing, dinosaurs might leave giant bones on earth; but ants might disappear and mix with the sands and winds,...... and their spirits might keep exploring the other places before the arriving steps of humankind's civilization........</strong><br>
<br>
<strong>No matter what, except giant bones, at least the big eggs of dinosaurs might give us some other ideas to create the shell structure for more great spaces without columns.</strong><br>
