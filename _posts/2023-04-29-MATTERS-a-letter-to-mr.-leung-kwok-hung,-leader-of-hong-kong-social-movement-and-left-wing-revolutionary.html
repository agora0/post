<p>A letter to Mr. Leung Kwok Hung</p><p><br></p><p> Dear Mr. Leung Kwok Hung:</p><p><br></p><p>     I am Wang Qingmin, a writer living in Europe.  When I was in middle school, I heard about your name and learned about your deeds from the media, newspapers, the Internet and other channels.  Whether you are fighting for the rights of the hard-working laborers and the suffering lower class, insisting on calling for the redress of June 4th and holding Beijing to account for the massacre for more than 30 years, or crying out for the Nanjing Massacre and other people who were killed by Japanese invaders, and the Wenchuan Earthquake  Raised funds for the disaster-stricken people in Sichuan, and supported many political prisoners and protesters in mainland China. I admire your sense of justice, courage, and action.  I have always wanted to meet you, but unfortunately I haven't had the chance for a long time.</p><p><br></p><p>     Five years ago, I went to Hong Kong for some personal matters and political appeals. I went to the Social Democracy League to visit you, but I couldn't find you.  A few days later, I went to the Liaison Office of the Central Committee of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to "step on the spot" to prepare for the protest. I happened to see you and other social citizens and colleagues carrying out the protest.  It’s just that there were many reporters and policemen around, and you left quickly. I was also worried about affecting your protests and interviews, so I couldn’t talk to you, and finally watched you leave.</p><p> </p><p>     A few days later, because I was unable to seek help everywhere in Hong Kong and I was in a desperate situation, I cut my wrists at the gate of the Hong Kong Liaison Office and was locked up in the psychiatric ward of Hong Kong Eastern District Hospital.  When Ms. Feng from the stake I contacted before visited me, I asked her to forward my information and appeal to you, and she agreed and told me that you had received it.  But later, when I was discharged from the hospital and returned to the mainland, I did not receive any further responses.</p><p><br></p><p>     Later, after going through various things and going to many places, I left mainland China and came to Europe.  Before I could settle down completely, I heard about the anti-extradition movement in Hong Kong.  In just over a year, Hong Kong's political opposition has been wiped out, and civil society has been completely destroyed.  And you're in jail too.  This is something I totally did not expect.</p><p><br></p><p>     In the past few years, regardless of the various accidents and changes in my own life, or the changes in China, Hong Kong, and the world that I have heard and seen, I have fully understood the impermanence of life and the world.</p><p><br></p><p>     But in this ever-changing situation, it is even more necessary to stick to sincerity.  And you are just a model of sticking to ideals, abiding by conscience, and defending justice for decades.  I have seen your experience and many deeds, and know that you have been committed to the socialist movement since the British period in Hong Kong, loved the country and the people, and are the vanguard of the left-wing revolution in Hong Kong.  The "Revolutionary Marxist League" you joined was one of the few political groups in Hong Kong that clearly opposed colonialism, capitalism, and conservatism in that era.</p><p><br></p><p>    In the June 7th Uprising (the June 7th riot, in fact, we are more suitable to call it an uprising. Although the uprising was used and hurt some innocent people (this indeed requires an apology and repentance), it is still anti-colonialism, anti-corruption,  After the suppression of the revolutionary struggle for justice, the left-wing movement in Hong Kong has been silent for a long time.  But you are not afraid of the high-handed dictatorship of the British colonial authorities in Hong Kong and the CCP regime colluded with it, you still stick to your ideals, and even go against the opposite, speaking out and fighting for labor, women, and the bottom, almost single-handedly, forcibly stepped out in Hong Kong.  A new way of "continuing the revolution" that is both radical, peaceful and sustainable.  Whether it is denouncing the CCP’s dictatorship, or criticizing the Hong Kong establishment (especially the Liberal Party and the Democratic Alliance for Betterment of Hong Kong) for ignoring the rights and interests of the people, they are all well-founded and powerful, forcing them to make some compromises and give up some vested interests to appease the workers and the bottom.</p><p>   </p><p>    It is because of you that Hong Kong laborers and people at the bottom have support and hope, so that this city full of barbaric capitalism and a huge gap between rich and poor still emits the light of social justice, equality and fraternity from the cracks.</p><p><br></p><p>    What is even more admirable is that you are not the kind of reverse nationalist who abandons the nation for left-wing revolution and internationalism.  On the contrary, your enthusiasm and sincerity of patriotism and love for the people far exceeds that of most mainland and port politicians and intellectuals.  Whether it is the protection of the Diaoyu Islands, the accusation of the Nanjing Massacre, the prosecution of the Japanese war and forced labor crimes, and the criticism of the colonial crimes of the US and European powers, as well as the evil deeds of the Hong Kong and British authorities in Hong Kong and the discrimination and oppression of Hong Kong people, all of them are fierce and intense.  Sincere, and never give up for decades.  Your sense of justice, courage, and national spirit make me look up at the sunrise in the east like a grass in the mountains, and get the teachings of the soul and the power of justice.</p><p><br></p><p>     The Sino-British negotiations and the return of Hong Kong were originally another phased victory of the national democratic revolution.  However, the motherland that Hong Kong returns to is not a true national democratic country, but rather an autocratic, barbaric capitalist, collaborating with conservative and reactionary forces in various countries.  This was not only the case during the Deng Xiaoping period, but also the Mao Zedong era.  Regardless of Mao Zedong's "thank you for Japan's invasion of China," his meeting with Nixon, or his kind treatment of blood-debt Latin American right-wing military officials such as Pinochet, the CCP has long betrayed the nation and its revolutionary ideals.  The Deng Xiaoping period not only continued these, but also launched the June 4th crackdown, destroying the century-old democratic dream of the Chinese nation.</p><p><br></p><p>    After the return of Hong Kong, the CCP, in addition to pretending to give some awards to a few people in the June 7th Uprising, has actually completely turned to the powerful and capitalists.  The CCP and the Hong Kong government are even more pro-power and pro-business than the Hong Kong and British governments. The living conditions of laborers and the underprivileged groups have not improved systematically.  When Hong Kong laborers and maids curled up in the "subdivided room", Li Qianxin and others were drinking and drinking in the "Wangbei Tower".  And for the two, the straight-line space distance may not exceed 500 meters.</p><p><br></p><p>     When dealing with the crimes of Japan’s invasion of China and Western colonialism, on the one hand, the CCP relied on these solidarity and bribed the hearts of the Chinese people to resist the infiltration of Western and universal values;  Criticize and pursue accountability, suppress real nationalism with false nationalism, replace, virtualize, and dilute the cohesion, unity, and emotions of the real and powerful Han nation with the constructed "Chinese nation", so as to facilitate its control over all ethnic groups in the country, including the Han people  people.  In the field of foreign affairs, whether it is Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States, or the big powers, they are all belittled and flattered, in order to win the favor of the countries, in exchange for the big powers to support the CCP’s rule of China, and to be the "dominant officials" of the big powers.  The people in Lugang, especially the people in the mainland, suffer from direct and indirect double exploitation by the CCP’s elite and foreign colonists. Whether it was the “friendship store” in the Mao era or the “sweatshop” in the Deng era, they all reflect the nature of a “semi-colonial and semi-feudal society”.  has not changed.</p><p><br></p><p>    The Shenzhen Jasic labor movement in 2018 was one of the few large-scale collective protests in China after June 4th, and it was also the peak of the Chinese labor movement, demonstrating the courage of the Chinese working class and the unity of workers and students.  However, the Jasic labor movement was eventually suppressed by the CCP regime. Many workers and young students were arrested, and offline and online communication was also banned.  This once again exposed the reactionary nature of the CCP regime as a powerful bourgeois regime.</p><p><br></p><p>     In the Huawei Meng Wanzhou incident, the CCP did not hesitate to capture foreigners as hostages and destroy China-Canada/China-US relations in exchange for this "princeling". However, the arrest of Hong Kong youths Guo Shaojie and Yan Minhua who went to Japan to protest the Yasukuni Shrine was ignored.  Don’t ask, once again the facts prove that the CCP regime is an “internal colonial” regime that only defends the interests of its privileged class, regardless of national interests and the rights of ordinary citizens.  (And during the Meng Wanzhou incident, a senior executive of Huawei in Poland was arrested. Both Huawei and the Chinese government quickly "cut seats" with him, which also reflects the CCP's differential treatment)</p><p><br></p><p>     Can such a "motherland" be loved?  Although the regime and the people are two different things, it has to be admitted that at least the vested interests in China and the young and middle-aged men with high education in China who have the advantage of the right to speak, whether they support the establishment of the CCP or the opposition against the CCP, no matter whether they are leftists or rightists in name  , are generally social Darwinists, reverse nationalists, fallacious nationalists, or even a combination of them (including some people you have supported and helped, and advocated for them before the Liaison Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China)  .  They are indistinguishable from or a mirror image of what the CCP publicly promotes or secretly encourages.  It is really not easy to "love" such a country and its citizens.</p><p><br></p><p>     And Hong Kong has become more and more "inlandized" in recent years. The Hong Kong establishment is highly tied to the CCP's powerful class, and the suppression and erosion of Hong Kong people's freedom is increasing day by day.  Compared with the British Hong Kong government, which still talks about the humanity of modern capitalism (even if it is hypocritical, limited in nature, and aimed at maintaining the rule of the bourgeoisie and colonial forces), the CCP promotes the social Darwinism of the weak and the strong, and  Using "patriotism" as a fig leaf has no real patriotism, and its hypocrisy and shamelessness are even greater than that of the British Hong Kong authorities.  As for the ideal pursuit of building a "new democratic society" and a "communist society" promised back then, it has long been thrown into the clouds.</p><p><br></p><p>     But in such a country and city, with such an ideology and reality, you have remained unchanged for decades, sticking to your original revolutionary aspirations and ideals, and striving for social justice.  In front of the Legislative Council, the Liaison Office of the Central People’s Government, Central, and Victoria Park, you denounced the shameful deeds of those high and low people again and again. You spoke out for labor and women, and supported domestic political prisoners and human rights defenders. You are sincere and powerful; for decades  Keep running around, dealing with various powers and complex and gray interest networks, fighting for the right to speak and legitimate gains for those who are powerless to speak out and resist, and keep your feet on the ground.</p><p><br></p><p> You have also been imprisoned many times for your resistance.  When I was detained by the police station and locked up in a mental hospital in Hong Kong due to protests and wrist slitting, I was unbearable just in the high-temperature environment of the detention room of the Western District Police Station for a few hours, even if I wanted to sing "The Internationale" silently.  With this experience, I can better understand and admire your tenacity, bravery and greatness.</p><p><br></p><p> There are no words to describe your words, deeds and spiritual quality, and there is nothing to add to the previous praises.</p><p><br></p><p>      However, after the anti-amendment movement and suppression in 2019-2020, the CCP regime completely tore up the contract of "Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong and a high degree of autonomy", abandoned the promise of "no change for 50 years", and took the opportunity to mobilize political opposition forces and even  The entire civil society in Hong Kong was completely destroyed.  Not only violent resistance was suppressed, even protests through peaceful means such as parliaments and demonstrations were not allowed.  This shows the insanity of Xi's CCP, and it also reflects the cruel world of darkness and depression in Hong Kong and the whole of China today.</p><p><br></p><p>     The situation not only in China, but in the whole world makes people feel uneasy and even pessimistic and painful.  The wave of progress that once swept the world, whether it is the Roosevelt State Administration, the 68th Movement, the third wave of democratization represented by the Carnation Revolution, the rise of the left wing in Latin America, the Arab Spring...all have passed and gone (although they have returned slightly.  , such as Brazil’s Lula defeating Bolsonaro), today’s world is the rise of right-wing conservative populism, from the Trump-Pence-Pompeo-DeSantis reactionary forces in the United States to Modi in India, Hungary’s  Orban in Russia, Putin in Russia, and even Shinzo Abe-Fumio Kishida in Japan, all regimes are undermining the peace and progress of the world, and the oppressed and vulnerable nations and people are suffering even more.</p><p><br></p><p>In Hong Kong, a strong local populist force also emerged, which split the pan-democrats, intensified the conflict between the mainland and Hong Kong, and together with the Xi regime broke some of the tacit understanding between the CCP and the non-establishment faction in Hong Kong, and led to anti-revisionism.  A series of violent conflicts in the example movement.  Of course, they should not be blamed, the CCP is the biggest culprit.  However, although what the nativists and militants in Hong Kong are doing is understandable and sympathetic, it is narrow-minded and short-sighted after all. It is difficult to promote freedom and democracy in Hong Kong, and it deviates from universal justice.  I respect them, but I also hope that they will eventually stand on the same side with the pan-democrats in Hong Kong and the oppressed people in mainland China.</p><p><br></p><p>     What is even more sad is that the revolutionary vanguard force that once represented advanced productive forces and new civilizations—the labor class, has undergone fission, and part of it has instead become an important part of the right-wing conservative populist forces.  On the one hand, they fight for rights and benefits for themselves, but on the other hand, they oppose women's rights, LGBT rights, ethnic minorities and other vulnerable groups' rights, and even oppose the profit of labor in other countries, competition and harm among labor, and they also listen to various conspiracy theories and  Hatred incites and becomes narrow-minded, anti-intellectual, and blindly obedient.  Although not all workers are like this, at least a considerable part of workers (whether in Europe, America or the third world) are indeed degenerate.</p><p><br></p><p>      In fact, the working class has always had two faces or even multiple faces.  On the one hand, labor is the core of productivity, the backbone of production relations, and the main force of human industrialization, modernization, and civilization.  Without labor, there would be no prosperous and great world today.  On the other hand, the working class is also self-interested, ignorant, and narrow-minded.  In China, the "worker aristocracy" of China's state-owned enterprises has degenerated into an exploiting class and rentiers during the Mao era. The value created is far less than the income, and it has become a conservative and stubborn force that hinders change.  The middle and lower class workers are worthy of respect, sympathy, and help in terms of their dedication and contribution in labor, but at least a considerable part of them are misogynistic, hostile to the weak (even if they themselves are weak), repulsive, cruel, and anti-intellectual.  Superstitious.  Even though these are fundamentally the oppression, brainwashing, and guidance of the ruling class, they themselves have to bear part of the blame.</p><p><br></p><p>     Even in the 19th and early 20th centuries, the working class had these problems, but compared with the feudal conservative forces and the original barbaric bourgeoisie, the conservatism and narrowness of the workers at that time were not prominent, and they even merged with progressive trends such as women's rights, and became  Most of the 20th century as part of progressive forces, siding with feminists, the disabled, minorities, etc.  But a century later, with the development of the times and the differentiation and combination of various forces, at least some laborers have regressed to a reactionary level similar to the workers in Nazi Germany and the Emperor-Military Department of Japan.  This pathetic depravity was best exemplified when Brazilian truck workers abandoned the Labor Party to fanatically support the far-right fascist Bolsonaro and call for the return of the junta.</p><p><br></p><p>     But these depravities are not entirely incomprehensible.  All kinds of exploitation, oppression, deceit, and violence leave workers in pain and confusion. It is also difficult for them to obtain a good education, and they are unable to have correct cognition and judgment. They are easily incited and used.  Although compared with the previous two centuries, the material conditions of labor have been greatly improved.  But "don't worry about scarcity but inequality, and don't worry about poverty but anxiety." The gap between rich and poor in various countries and the imbalance of economic and political development in the world all damage the dignity and interests of workers.  With the transformation of industries, the development of artificial intelligence, and the spread of "rust belt states", the working class in traditional industries is more anxious and lost than in the old days of material scarcity, and is naturally easily attracted by extreme thoughts.</p><p><br></p><p>     However, the political and economic elites and mainstream intellectuals do not fully understand and care about the situation and suffering of laborers, and they have even faded significantly compared to the old days.  Today's left-wing forces, especially the elite left-wing, are more inclined to more "fashionable" and "champagne-like" issues such as women's rights, sexual minorities, and environmental protection (of course, these issues are not really "champagne"-style vanity, but real  important issue, but does distract from labor rights issues).  The neglect and even abandonment of the elite has aggravated the dissatisfaction and sense of rejection of the workers. It is more understandable to turn to conservative forces to seek real interests and seek a sense of psychological security and belonging.</p><p><br></p><p>     But understanding is understanding. The populism, conservatism, and narrowing of labor are serious damage to both the long-term interests of labor itself and the peace and progress of the world.</p><p><br></p><p>     In short, in today's world, there are turbulent countercurrents, frequent conflicts, and divisions and confrontations between various identity groups.  Compared with decades ago, the world is not more united, but more divided.  The totalitarianism of the "Chinese model", Russian expansionism, conservative national populism in India and Japan, and right-wing hegemony in the United States and Europe all make this world full of ugliness, the weak are humiliated and swallowed, and the future of mankind is bleak.  The completely unjust war between Russia and Ukraine in the past year has shown the world how fragile civilization is with blood, dead bodies, and the destruction of families.</p><p><br></p><p>     In such a chaotic and extreme era, not only are there no "full-armed prophets" to clean up the evil and rebuild the world, but there are also no "disarmed prophets" and "exiled prophets".  Peng Shuzhi and Wang Fanxi, who were slightly influential back then, have passed away. As for Chen Duxiu, a Trotskyist with excellent qualities, talents, and a democratic standpoint, there is nowhere to be found.  Except for a few countries where the Fourth International is still active, it has become a symbolic organization as a whole, unable and unwilling to promote the continuous revolution and renewal of the world.</p><p><br></p><p>     Where is the way out for Hong Kong, mainland China, and the world in the future?  Ten years ago, there was quite a blueprint and hope, but in recent years it has become chaotic.</p><p><br></p><p>     However, the light of hope still exists, and it is on you and other people with lofty ideals who are temporarily in trouble, on your like-minded descendants, and on people around the world who love freedom, democracy, and pursue fairness and justice.  The "blank paper revolutions" that spread across China at the end of last year reflected that even though the totalitarian regime was oppressive, there were still many people, including young workers and students, who bravely struggled against the power and uttered a new generation of shocking voices.</p><p><br></p><p>     According to various information, many warriors in the "white paper revolution" were directly and indirectly influenced by the ideas of freedom, democracy, and justice that emerged and spread from Hong Kong, which contributed to the renewal of their values ​​and actions in reality.  Since the CCP ruled mainland China and carried out a series of suppressions, massacres, and literary inquisitions, the people in the mainland have generally lost their spines, broken their spines, and lost their morals.  It is Hong Kong, to be precise, patriotic democrats from all walks of life in Hong Kong, who have continued the pride of the Chinese people, repaired the broken backbone, and inherited the spirit of Chinese civilization.</p><p><br></p><p>    And you are the hardest rib among Hong Kong people. Together with Si Tuhua, Li Zhuoyan, Ho Junren, Gu Siyao and others, you have supported Hong Kong's unyielding backbone and passed on and carried forward the national spirit of self-improvement and bravery.  When the mainland, from the government to the people, is servile to the strong, tramples on the weak, is full of lies, breaks promises everywhere, keeps silent for the public and twitters for itself, and is immersed in material desires and private struggles, it is you and other Hong Kong people with lofty ideals who are united  Be fair, upright and brave, speak without hesitation, plead for the people, say what mainlanders don’t want to say, and do what mainlanders dare not do, so that the Chinese nation, which has been plagued by disasters and long-term sinking, still retains conscience and courage in the corner of the Xiangjiang River  , so that many victims really got help and warmth.</p><p><br></p><p> These, many people in mainland China bear in mind.  Although many people have been deceived, bewitched, and instigated, not all mainland Chinese have been brainwashed.  Especially for you, all mainlanders who know you, regardless of their political stance, basically admire you.  There are many misunderstandings and misunderstandings about other Hong Kong democrats, but there are also sober ones.  What you have done for the mainland is worthwhile, and I am also grateful to you and all patriotic democrats in Hong Kong.</p><p><br></p><p>     The suppression after the anti-amendment movement and the "National Security Law" are trying to break the backbone of the Hong Kong people, so that the last steadfast land of the Han people will also be conquered.  From a practical perspective, they have succeeded.  However, people not only have a body, but also a spirit and a soul.  For warriors, even if they are imprisoned or killed, their aspirations will not change.</p><p><br></p><p>    Although this is somewhat self-comforting, it is not just self-comforting.  In the history of the Han nationality and the history of the world, violence and darkness are frequent and last longer than light.  In the Dark Ages, it was indeed difficult for people to overcome the barbaric and unscrupulous conquerors.  However, people can use various methods, including perseverance of the heart and resistance of the mind, to accumulate strength and spread civilization, waiting for the future light.</p><p><br></p><p>     You have gone through many prisons, and you have survived each time with tenacity, and you have become more determined and brave.  This time, there will be no exception.  Although even if he is released from prison, the outside world will not have the former freedom, but life is still there, and everything is possible.  Compared with the death of the Jacobins on the guillotine, the death of the Paris Commune members in the cemetery, the death of the Russian Civil War and Stalin's purge of the Trotskyites, there are still more possibilities for resistance and room for maneuver.</p><p><br></p><p>     Struggle and revolution are difficult, and construction is even more difficult.  Although the history of left-wing revolutions of more than two centuries has created many brilliance, it has also brought or exacerbated various disasters.  From the cruelty of Soviet Russia to the ruthlessness of Red China, from the secret shadow of the Stasi east of the Berlin Wall to the tyranny of the Kim Dynasty north of the 38th parallel, despicable atrocities are everywhere on the "Shining Path".  "Communism", how many crimes are in your name!</p><p><br></p><p>     Orwell's "Nineteen Eighty-Four" and "Animal Farm" most clearly revealed the truth that such a so-called communist regime is actually a "Big Brother" dictatorship.  "All animals are created equal, but some animals are more equal than others", a hero like "Big Brother"/"Napoleon" can always win this kind of reverse elimination and dominate hundreds of millions of subjects; while "Goldstein  "/"Snowball", no matter how brilliant his achievements are, he only made a wedding dress for "Big Brother". The military and political system created to liberate and defend the people has turned into an organ that harms the people.  But now the CCP’s big data totalitarian system, its tentacles are widely distributed and densely distributed, which has far exceeded Orwell’s imagination.  (But Orwell saw and even partially experienced this, and still insisted on socialist ideals, clearly stating that he was a democratic socialist, not a right-wing liberal as some Chinese liberals twisted it)</p><p><br></p><p>     If Marx and Trotsky traveled to the present and saw the rise and fall and changes of the red countries, and the hardship and humiliation of the common people and the disadvantaged better than Tsarist Russia and the Republic of China, they might give up many of their previous propositions and prefer European society  Democratic, "revisionist" model, right?  (However, we cannot deny the greatness of the communist ideal and the value of continuous revolution because of the red calamity in the past. If peace and prosperity are based on the humiliation of the common people, especially the bottom class, it is better to stand up and donate.  Turn splendor into scorched earth)</p><p><br></p><p>    What should the future world be like?  From Confucius and Mozi in the pre-Qin period, to Plato and Aristotle in Greece, from the Eastern "learning from things" to the "Encyclopedia" in the West, from Mannletto's theory of radical violent revolution to the Social Democrats' "Encyclopedia"  Gotha Program" and the "Third Way/New Middle Way" that gradually emerged in the 1990s... how many people are thinking and summarizing.  The ups and downs of human history and the rise and fall of regimes all tell people that "comrades still need to work hard."  The predecessors have done what should be done, and the road behind needs to be explored and thought by future generations.</p><p><br></p><p>     After decades of ups and downs and life-and-death struggles, you must have thought more and deeper than me, a junior.  I also hope that you will think more about the future of Hong Kong and the mainland, and the blueprint of the world.</p><p><br></p><p>    Although, maybe it's too late?  The crisis caused by climate warming may make Hong Kong a highly inhospitable place in a few decades, and will be submerged in a hundred years.  Mainland China and even most parts of the world will also frequently suffer from high temperatures, floods, and droughts brought about by the climate crisis.  This will be a challenge more difficult to reverse and contend than politics.</p><p><br></p><p>     But perhaps a solution or mitigation will be found before the climate crisis is completely out of hand?  However, it is true that we should not be too "unfounded", and we still have to be rational and calm, do our best in our limited life, think and change, instead of smashing the cans and letting go.</p><p><br></p><p>     The perverse actions of the Xi regime over the past few years have made Chinese workers even more "hardworking and poor". White-collar "996" and migrant workers shed blood and sweat every day, and they can hardly pay off their mortgages all their lives.  violence; Chinese middle school students have been doing useless work for six years from 6 am to 10 pm; Chinese women (whether girls or women) are bullied, harassed, and hurt.  , never had full rights and dignity.  Others, such as the disabled, AIDS and leprosy patients, prison inmates, etc., have been discriminated against and abused all the year round.  Under the continuous humiliation from the state machine to the hooligans in the city, he lost the most basic human dignity and the courage to resist a little.</p><p><br></p><p>    At this time, it is even more necessary for someone to speak on their behalf, express their resentment and demands, help them muster up courage, rebuild their dignity, and work with them to fight against power, find a way out, and promote change.  "Continuous revolution" includes not only political revolution, but also economic revolution and social revolution.  The people of mainland China are the most constrained and oppressed people in the world other than the Korean people, and they also need reform and liberation the most.  Their eyes were poked, their ears were closed, their mouths were gagged, their arms were amputated, their hands and feet were amputated, and their brains were washed. People all over the world who pursue justice and peace should see, hear, speak, and do things for them.  They aid vision and hearing, restore speech, connect limbs, enlighten minds, and awaken consciences, allowing them to gradually regain their self-reliance and become a beneficial force that benefits both themselves and others, the public interest, and world civilization.</p><p><br></p><p>     You and many people with lofty ideals in Hong Kong have spoken out for the people of the mainland for decades, and I am very grateful.  However, it is obviously difficult for the people in mainland China to fight independently, and you and your younger generations are still needed to speak for the people of the country.</p><p><br></p><p>    I also know that today’s Hong Kong people, apart from the pro-establishment faction who are running dogs of the CCP, are more local populists, the traditional pan-democracy is on the decline, and the radical left is even rarer.  But in this city where a series of revolutionary struggles broke out, there are still many deep and passionate fighters.  The famous artist Huang Qiusheng is very interested in the Fourth International, and he is also keen on criticizing realist literature and historiography.  He has cultivated many younger generations, and there will always be some who are willing to inherit his mantle and ideas, right?</p><p>I think you are the same.  Although today’s rebellious Hong Kong people are mostly similar to Joshua Wong, Law Guancong, Yau Wai-ching, Ho Guilan and others in their views on local self-determination and Hong Kong city-stateism, they sneer at left-wing and Greater Chinaism.  But that shouldn't be the case, right?  Ms. Zou Xingtong and Ms. He Jiehong are both new representatives of progressivism and concern for human rights in mainland China.  But it is indeed too few and marginalized.</p><p><br></p><p>    I hope that after you are released from prison, you can give more teachings to young people in Hong Kong who are interested in justice, and tell them the hardships of the people in mainland China over the past century or even hundreds of years, as well as the current situation and despair.  I also hope that you will tell them where the blood, culture, and values ​​of Hong Kong people are rooted.  Young people in Hong Kong may be disgusted and stay away from mainlanders because of their low quality, distorted values, and social ugliness.  But isn't the current situation of the mainland and its people not "Looking at the clouds in a severe drought, thinking of good generals in national disasters", and needing the rescue of the "International Column"?</p><p><br></p><p>     One hundred and forty million souls are in pain, numbness, and sinking.  There must be a contemporary Prometheus, bringing hope to their hearts and clarifying the dark day of the motherland.  Regardless of Hong Kong, Taiwan, or other countries in the world, those who can bring democracy, progress, and justice to China, the people of the country with a heart are grateful.</p><p><br></p><p>    Of course, the realization of freedom and democracy in mainland China fundamentally requires the rise of the mainland people themselves.  The premise for external support to play a role is also that the mainland people should respond and cooperate, instead of treating it as a "hostile foreign force" and hating it.  Regarding mainlanders' attitudes towards Hong Kong's democrats, the changes in the relationship between mainland and Hong Kong people in the past few years are indeed disappointing and even desperate answers.  However, this should not be the case permanently.  For example, many mainlanders have experienced all kinds of torture under the three-year "clearing" policy of closing the city and segregating the city. Their hatred of the anti-amendment movement in Hong Kong has changed to understanding, respect and even support.  But now that Yi Zong continues to go against the law and the people are full of grievances, perhaps the people of the country will understand more about the values, ideals, courage and persistence of Hong Kong people, and unite again to fight against violence.</p><p><br></p><p>    If the mainland people who have experienced all kinds of torture are still unable to wake up in a few years and still hate Hong Kong's liberal and democratic forces, then these people are neither worth saving nor can they be saved.</p><p>    </p><p>    In any case, I still hope that you will not regret your original intentions, stick to your ideals and fighting spirit, and pass them on to more people.  I was inspired and inspired by you (of course there are other role models, such as Yue Fei, Lin Zhao, Xu Zhiyong), and I have persisted all the way to this day.  Of course, the persistence of a small pawn will not help the overall situation.  But if thousands of small soldiers unite as one, the flag of liberty will be reborn in the sky, and the bell of liberty will ring again.  Without struggle, how can there be change?  Help the weak and support the leaning, without hesitation - this is not only the motto of the Social Democratic Federation, but also the common motto of every son and daughter of China.</p><p><br></p><p>     There are many things that cannot be written or said.  The feelings mentioned above are also quite fragmented.  There may be a chance to get back in touch later.  I hope you will be released from prison as soon as possible, and I wish you and your lover, Ms. Chen, peace and health.</p><p><br></p><p> Wang Qingmin</p><p><br></p><p> 2023.4.26</p><p><br></p><p> 231 Year of the Republican Calendar Flower Month Lily of the Valley Day</p>
