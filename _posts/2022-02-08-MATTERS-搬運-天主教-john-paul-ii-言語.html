<p>本來水了篇攻擊對某某教義的理解，有站上有位馬特友好心提醒這教義可以理解為甚麼，我是知道的，因著我成長環境即是基督教的教會學校，還是多謝提醒。</p><p>過多怨氣總是不好，在信仰方面就正能量一點吧，無謂的教派和教義理解之爭還是算了，信仰之爭爭不出個頭，愛怎理解就怎理解也可。</p><p><a href="https://www.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/audiences/1998/documents/hf_jp-ii_aud_09091998.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">引自 1998 年，天主教教宗 John Paul II 的言語 [1]</a></p><hr><p>2. It must first be kept in mind that every quest of the human spirit for truth and goodness, and in the last analysis for God, is inspired by the Holy Spirit. The various religions arose precisely from this primordial human openness to God. At their origins we often find founders who, with the help of God’s Spirit, achieved a deeper religious experience. Handed on to others, this experience took form in the doctrines, rites and precepts of the various religions.</p><p>In every authentic religious experience, the most characteristic expression is prayer. Because of the human spirit’s constitutive openness to God’s action of urging it to self-transcendence<strong>, </strong>we can hold that “every authentic prayer is called forth by the Holy Spirit, who is mysteriously present in the heart of every person” (<em>Address to the Members of the Roman Curia, </em>22 Dec. 1986, n. 11; <em>L’Osservatore Romano </em>English edition, 5 Jan. 1987, p. 7).</p><p>3. The Holy Spirit is not only present in other religions through authentic expressions of prayer. “The Spirit’s presence and activity”, as I wrote in the Encyclical Letter <a href="http://www.vatican.va/edocs/ENG0219/_INDEX.HTM" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Redemptoris missio</em></a><em>, </em>“affect not only individuals but also society and history, peoples, cultures and religions” (n. 28).</p><p>Normally, “it will be in the sincere practice of what is good in their own religious traditions and by following the dictates of their own conscience that the members of other religions respond positively to God’s invitation and receive salvation in Jesus Christ, even while they do not recognize or acknowledge him as their Saviour (cf. <a href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_decree_19651207_ad-gentes_en.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Ad gentes</em></a><em>, </em>nn. 3, 9, 11)” (Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue – Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples, Instruction <em>Dialogue and Proclamation, </em>19 May 1991, n. 29; <em>L’Osservatore Romano </em>English edition, 1 July 1991, p. III).</p><hr><p>之前那篇水文，最後感「當初反抗墮落權威有些人變得僵硬，昔日的墮落權威卻反而慢慢柔軟」，有些失望和驚訝無法隱藏，成長背景親和基督教，親人和朋友有不同教派的基督教徒，他們的畫風我是熟悉且感到舒適。</p><p>所以更多希望基督宗教更向傾向於這種熟悉，當然也明白，更多的信仰組織形態到底為何，且近年的氛圍越發為何，傾向為何，有些事的確是遙遠的幻想，未來更多是不斷的爭端。</p><hr><p><br></p><p>[1] <a href="https://www.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/audiences/1998/documents/hf_jp-ii_aud_09091998.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/audiences/1998/documents/hf_jp-ii_aud_09091998.html</a></p>
