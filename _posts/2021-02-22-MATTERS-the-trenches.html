<h1><a href="https://allpoetry.com/poem/15715203-The-Trenches-by-Simon-Cheng-Wai-Him" target="_blank">The Trenches</a></h1><p>This is a sultry noon,</p><p>Feeling tried and sluggish.</p><p>The hollow, greedy eye,</p><p>Gaze to the mirror.</p><p>To figure out</p><p>What makes me bogged down</p><p>with my wife’s silence,</p><p>what she is drink-shaped</p><p>and swallow the lonely.</p><p>Or</p><p>with my cracked mirror,</p><p>which it reflecting</p><p>my fading faces</p><p>that fade into the rifts</p><p>the mirror I plead to,</p><p>which the anxiety leaking from the rifts</p><p>seep into the bentwood chair,</p><p>my shaken hands</p><p>and this paper</p><p>beyond the words.</p><p>While a cloud pressed</p><p>Above my garage.</p><p>I had to tell myself</p><p>What it is matter</p><p>to dig a trench,</p><p>a trench with coward size,</p><p>that I can see the dog’s bone,</p><p>and my bone in the future.</p>
