Those who copied the "Declaration of the 21st Century Peace New Deal" on the Internet， or helped to nominate the "Declaration" and its executive leaders to win the Nobel Peace Prize nominatio，will be recorded as a member of the Salvation Group.Aims to make the "Declaration" a household name, and finally implement it on a global scalew；Obama gang Manipulating the U.S. election, once again showing the corruption and collapse of global party politics, will set off the "21st Century New Deal" fever!</p><p><br></p><p>《21世纪和平新政宣言》</p><p>---孙中山旗下唯一有利两岸统一且各方都易接受的，改革西式政体一切政党社团参政议政都不执政的，中西结合优化五权分立的(民)选(科)举智者治国的，否定全盘西化作世上唯一强有力论证的21世纪和平新政（以下“【】”内文字为非正文内容的说明）</p><p>    20世纪苏联的消亡和东欧的大变革，使这21世纪初的现中国大陆成为世界关注的最主要焦点和影响新世纪和平文明发展的关键。特别是大陆这些年对外意识形态普遍大规模输出，震撼整个世界；全球各国对本世纪大陆十几年里两次引发严重病毒疫情的反思；美中关系恶化实际已打响人类意识形态领域最后的冷战甚至有引发热战危险；海峡两岸也有触发冲突大风险；香港不断的大规模游行动荡；与南海邻国关系紧张，世界和平受到严重挑战。大陆经济急速下滑衰退，内外矛盾激化高端深感前所未有的严重危机，高端甚至反复提高到防“亡党”的严重程度。美国发展到以禁止高科技芯片进入中国大陆的要害制裁，遏制和衰萎大陆发展，高端强调过毛时代“紧日子 ”。其实美国这种高科技芯片要害制裁只能维持” 仅仅几年“ ，IBM公司去年宣布几年后量子计算机商用等等高科技飞速发展可证明，标志着可以无需现行芯片非仅仅是当代计算机的多元高科技时代将开始，新的同时起跑状态将呈现，问题是，不要在这 ” 仅仅几年“  就倒下！“21世纪和平新政”就是唯一理想而有效的救急。包括中共上下在内的几乎国内外所有人都很清楚，大陆已到必须政治体制改革的时候了，大变革将是民意世潮下的必然结果。中国大陆内外即全球正合力促成这人口第一大国的大变革大复兴，这也为中国开创新政治体制提供了一次最佳机会。</p><p><br></p><p>       综合各政体和各国现实，绝大多数国家改革或变革选择了西方政体，但西方政体固有的越来越明显的缺陷已成为有人攻击、拒绝或怀疑的理由。这也是近年来西方国家出现了宽容那必将灭亡的独裁专制政府的左派当选，是不少选民失去信心的表现和原因。不仅如此，西方现政体的缺陷还有:  很难产生最佳决策而大多是不优不劣成心对抗后的折衷方案使施政不理想选民失去信心；财团商界巨头对政治影响过大；对立政党轮流执政决策易翻来覆去劳民伤财前后混乱选民也易失去信心; 并不只是几人而是几党几大群体竟争最高权力，强对抗易使社会撕裂更易使选民失望；另外还有竞选的形象口才和资金作用偏重，不利于博才寡言的理论家和不利于无大财团资助的竞选人；大多数博才的却不善辩的竞选人易被仅仅是形象口才好的竞选人击败等等；最明显的例子，西式政体在伊拉克之类的国家就完全失败，根本无法解决誓不两立的多党多教派的和平执政问题；还有俄国和美英法德等西方甚至世界各国政坛媒体最高端政客及左派，被极左Antifa等组织全球总后台暗地收买，极左惯用的腐败这“灵丹妙药”不仅收买拉拢一批大陆高官，还长期不断收买拉拢大批各国高官。如联合国人权组织、WHO、美国两党和VOA等要员被收买为腐败统治辩护或服务极为普遍。美国政坛巨商媒体等各界近代最黑恶势力是在极左全球总后台暗地收买下，在克林顿掌权时兴起，在奥巴马和拜登掌权时黑恶势力全面壮大，美国政坛巨商媒体等机构和部门几乎全被极左腐蚀收买，大有颠覆美国体制之势。黑恶政党政治诸如“肯尼迪刺死事件”、"奥巴马门"、”希拉里邮件门“和“拜登父子门”黑暗丑恶事件一个接一个，最典型的奥巴马、拜登和贺锦丽等人及其中私家企业被极左及他国政府收买，奥巴马甚至暗示离美去加拿大逃避罪责，全球应高度关注！还有早年共和党的老布什甚至为了贸易和私利，而容忍独裁者屠杀人民的惊世事件。他们都是为打击政敌和为其个人及政党利益而丢弃原则不顾国家利益；甚至美国有市议会通过废除警察局或成立短命极左政府等荒唐之举，选举年更易出现街头暴动打砸抢；基辛格也被收买去重庆支持极左薄熙来夺权唱红多次为极左服务，更荒谬绝伦。特别是2020美国总统大选，民主党政客和大多数美国媒体被全球极左总后台长期全力收买后的极端做法可谓“文革“2.0国际版，在危急和震撼美国及世界的奥巴马和拜登黑恶势力恐怖操控2020大选突显美宪法危机之后，完全政党政治面临死亡将掀起"21世纪新政"热。而实西式政体的治国并非和平举贤利国利民的理想制度，西式政体势必改革完善，使注重发展孙中山五权分立的考试和监察更有必要。改革西式政体一切政党社团参政议政都不执政，中西结合优化五权分立(民)选(科)举智者治国，实施否定全盘西化作世上唯一强有力佐证的21世纪和平新政。另外，美国无限泛滥混血的全国灰色人种化，结果显而易见，若干年后美国将没有白种人黄种人和黑种人，终将全是“灰色“人种。是一例纯种人的自寻消失，一国还可，他国不可推广，物种特别是人种的保护更为人类重中之重，旨为人类非灰一色的丰富多彩而圆满理想的未来，所以这一点也证明“美国模式”并非最佳榜样。各派严重对立社会撕裂不利和平威胁地区安全的台湾模式也无需效仿，地震多发地台湾的台独意识是朝向断祖绝孙。日本也是地震多发岛屿，从日本近代史可见，多年许多决策高层都有扩张野心，侵略南北韩和中国等陆地，因为他们知道自己的子孙后代,终将会在一次地震中遇难绝后的概率极大，也出于私心而野蛮侵略大陆等地而不安心于日本岛。可是亲日的李登辉却去开创撕裂社会不利和平的台独断祖绝后危局，实是一大因弃大陆而会导致许多家族断祖绝孙的短见，只迎合无远见阶层的愚眛，也对地区和平及全球安全不利。</p><p> </p><p>      动荡震撼世界的的美国2020大选也揭示了这21世纪初的人类信仰危机，有神论与无神论及极右与极左的交锋已至生死决斗登锋造极。其实与人战胜自然的创举相似，非自然或超自然的"神"力是有的，人不能自以为至极，在无限之中"人"与"自然"是有限的定义。不过这个"神"或其"化身"不会是凡间人类，一切活佛神话都是虚构。可以引入"N 阶宇宙"或"N 阶世界"的概念，不论何时若把已知微观世界看成N之N1阶，宏观世界看成N之Nn阶，那么人类只能认识N1至Nn 阶，此外N-1、N-2、N-3...和N+1、N+2、N+3...阶等等永有未知。不同的观察和分析方法会有不同的形态和规律等局限结果。因此值得强调的是，实质与真理是无穷多的有限条件下科学描述之和，乃无穷大。生命只是物质运动和存在的无穷多形式之一. 未知微世界和未知宏世界的"未知生命"、“超生命”或超生命之极限即“神”, 都不能用已知生命来定义、分析和寻找。也就是说, 人类可以不断发现, 不断获取此类知识, 但不会最终找到细胞基因之下极限"基因"或超人之上极限"超人"。发现和找出规律是神圣美妙的，探索必有错出错也有其价值之处。为此信神的人不妨猜想，也许唐山大震、日本和台湾不断的地震，或许是神知极左、军国主义和台独撕裂社会的危险而起的搔动吧，中国人常言"老天有眼"或许是不完全归纳法的结论，我看"老天也无情"，至少是它与人间对情的定义无法一样。还是积德才能心安理得，如数千年之中原大陆是华人祖宗牢靠的根据地，就象地球是人类的根据地一样应当保全，不可分裂和破坏。 一切需要和平，一切基于科学，一切为了发展。新的世纪随文明和教育的发展，应以法治和德理相结合，法治的存在旨在维护社会公德，应以公法与公德的社会治与理相结合，即法治与德理，治标与理本相结合；以民众与学者、民意与学理相结合，如公民直选与学者科举的选与举相结合；以东西方文明及各民族文化精华相结合，开创高速发展的新21世纪。</p><p><br></p><p>       中国是影响新世纪和平文明发展的关键，人们也普遍希望中国大变革应该和平过渡避免付出巨大社会成本和沉重代价，新世纪社会变革更要终止杀人流血。旨在也包括左翼的更多中国人欢迎和接受的,  不完全西化中西结合的，有利两岸和平统一的，最佳选择必是都相聚在中共也一贯崇敬的孙中山先生的旗帜下，完善健全和发展孙中山的五权分立体制，实施本文倡导的21世纪和平新政。这一使命由中共真改革派完成所付代价则最小，应当引起他们的高度关注，劝其为国为民勇于担当。 倒退则是自取灭亡，必是遗臭万年的中华民族的大罪人。中共改革派和大多数党员也不会愿意被往往只可能得势一时的极左倒退势力捆绑连累，中共改革派要去做的第一件事是促成落实中共曾在联合国签署的《世界人权宣言》包括中共所立宪法的基本人权和自由。【中共也许有人会说这是使党变色，那这几十年变的色还少吗？不是那些名“社”实“资”的变色不就早和前东欧苏联一样完蛋了吗？既是如此无可否认就再变最后一次又何妨？而且已是面临无法逃避的大变革前夜，天堂与地狱只一念一步之差！“资本主义社会”其实是来源于马克思主义的贬义词，是指西方自由民主社会。】只有中国完成了顺民意世潮的大变革，才是开创21世纪全新的和平文明世界的开始。</p><p> </p><p>      否定全盘西化改革西方民主制，加入东方元素，将孙中山先生的西式完全政党政治较浓厚的五权分立体制，进一步改革为不完全政党政治，中国古代就有“结党营私”一说。所有政党社团参政议政都不执政，无执政党和在野党之分， 避免执政党自身权益高于国家及其一切的完全政党政治弊病。除了那拒绝政改变革而要倒退的是主动自杀，将不会有执政党下台被动推翻消亡或执政地位被他党取代的艰险和痛苦从而长存久安。【这是中共唯一可选择的避免亡党的主动体面而又圆满的过渡,  是和平自救或重整求生的唯一有利有效的办法。包括中共在内的几乎所有世人都认为中共政治体制改革已到尽头，再真政改只会亡党或改名，这里提出的新政则是使其可不亡党也可不改名的唯一圆满理想的办法，而且在这转型过程中中共仍可能会是人数第一大党。】中共转型为参政议政党，同样如此，海内外华人其他政党社团也应放弃争取执政的目标也仅参政议政，为全中华复兴和和平统一，发挥高尚的政治智慧和修养，修改各自政党社团和要员个人的利益诉求，放弃过高权力欲望更改奋斗目标，以两岸各地全中国各族人民的利益为重，为世界树立榜样。【若如此，可以说历史进程偏偏給中共以任何政党社团都不易有的改革出新型政体真正复兴中华的优先机会，应当明智果断地把握住，失之必然逃不过亡党有的受审被彻底清算的命运。】</p><p> </p><p>      华人必定都希望中国和平统一复兴一个文明而又富强甚至为第一强国，这一伟大使命也需要全球所有华人和政党社团以及政治家们的共同努力。这可供和平过渡的，孙中山旗下唯一有利两岸统一且两岸都易接受的，中西结合优化五权分立真正落实考试权的高智商群体智者治国的，一切政党社团参政议政都不执政不完全政党政治的，否定全盘西化作世上唯一强有力论证的，及优化改革完善甚至可谓挽救现西方政体的21世纪和平新政，即士辅民主的“三府合政”制。其分权为手段合政为目的，其架构概述为：</p><p><br></p><p>1，改革孙中山先生提出的五权分立和西式三权分立为三府合政: （1）由新科举考试后全民大选出的行政府（可简称官府），其各机构和职能与西式三权分立之行政相似；（2）民选不需新科举考试的旨在立法的议政府（可简称民府），其各机构和职能与西式三权分立之议会相似；（3）新科举考试不需民选的具多重制衡权的理政府（可简称士府），理政府包括行使提供全民免费的教育院、医疗社保院等生存权【中共强调的】；文物院、（包括专利的）私产院和（包括国土的）资源院等资产权；科学院、智库和考试院等考试权；检查院、廉政院和法院等司法权；（包括报刊和网络的）传媒院、诚信院和监察院等监察权等的，组成松散结合的理政府，因此，理政府还具有小部分专业性极强的行政功能和部分西式议会参议院功能。</p><p><br></p><p>2，每届政府任期四年，行政府和议政府的大选为四年一届次，新科举考试为两年一次。参加科举的人必须是经体检、诚信和前科等资格审查的规定范围的名校博士获得者。参加科举考试不管是否考上是否任职过最多可参加三届，新科举考试是主题为行政科管理学、政治科法学和经济学，加辅题即全部众多学科。新科举考试是超极限数量和范围之试题的考试，和才能智商检测（此项检测跟随高科技发展逐步推进深化）。</p><p><br></p><p>3，最终引入逐步精细化的公正而且高效的“投票份额”制，即选举公决和提案表决等一切重要公事投票表决的，历次累积的取决于对错结果并经电脑统计出的，每人每次投票的各自不同不断变化的“份额”，并记入诚信、资历和各资格等项。使所有人所有重要投票表决更认真谨慎，特别是更为有效。科举考试及大选、政迹统计、新政评估和投票份额等等要充分紧跟并利用不断飞速发展的电脑网络技术的资源和作用，不断提高新政的管理水平。</p><p><br></p><p>4，行政府总理（兼军警最高统帅）由最早新科举考试的未任过两届总理参选最多三次的申请参选的，两名头名科举贤士为总理候选人，并同样在这些头名贤士中自主结合成两组竞选伙伴受总理级保护，再全民大选出正副总理，总理最多可竞选连任一届。各正副部长级行政府官员由总理对口在各届科举考试合格的贤士中任命，经另两府半数通过，可被辞但无再聘次数限制。各省（特区）及市县（区）正副行政长官每职位取两名，在各届科举考试合格贤士中按规定届序名次经电脑处理出的申请参选人经当地选民选出，其他官员由其行政长官任命。</p><p><br></p><p>5，各级行政长官当选后辞去原社团党派教派之类职务，行政不带社团教派党派偏见，按需灵活择取各方各党各派争辩而出的非仅一方一党的全部最优决策。【避免西式体制因执政党的变更而翻来复去折腾。】只有行政府设至市县（区）级行政机构止和其下仅设办事处即乡办镇办及基层村办街办，议政府和理政府设至省（特区）级止其之下各级均不设立，仅由议政府和理政府常设适量“巡视组”据案需巡回暂驻于所辖市县（区）行政府院内，议政府和理政府事务及案件（如起诉立案）可广泛运用互联网。简化西式体制机构的繁杂臃肿，行政府是“管”的概念必须设至市县（区），而议政府和理政府是“议”和“裁”的概念，完全可充分运用互联网及其视频而简政减员和废止其市县（区）级机构。</p><p><br></p><p>6，以辖内注册的各党各派各社团身份或个人身份之参选者经资格审查后均可角逐中央议政府和各省（特区）议政府议员，经由各省（特区）民选出不需科举考试，当选届次不限。其正副议长由议政府当届议员选出得票最多者担任，中央议政府议员加各省（特区）正副议长的总人数与另两府参加三府联席会议的人数相当。【不会被动推翻或消亡的而只要回归一度曾放弃暴力革命和阶级斗争等教条的现共产党，放弃违宪易撕裂社会的台独主张的民进党和孙中山开创的国民党等以及经辖内注册的海内外华人政党社团,  都可在两岸各地发展并竞选各级议政府正副议长或议员。】</p><p><br></p><p>7，理政府的正副理士、院士、考官、检查官和法官等要员及各省（特区）理政府要员由各届新科举考试合格人士即贤士，根据其新科举考试主题分数和辅题对口学科分数排名，可参照原名校获得的博士专业或从事的工作专业分类入档，定期内三志愿对口投档按规定届序名次经电脑处理再公榜后上任。不需民选，也不由行政长官任命不对之负责，只依宪法法律为国服务，并行使仅不包括需“三府一团联席会议"裁决的一切各案裁决，不同与西式政体，使司法权、监察权和考试权等更分权独立。每界理政府正副理士、院士、考官、检查官和法官等要员任期四年后卸职，重新科考中榜才可连任。卸职后留理政府还原为理政府贤士，可接受理政府“巡视组”任职或行政府正副行政长官之外的职务任命。</p><p><br></p><p>8，立法提案三府均可经简单多数提出由各府参与审核，行政府提案先交理政府可作修正案再齐交议政府审定其一或过三分之二通过废止；理政府提案先交行政府可作修正案再齐交议政府审定其一或过三分之二通过废止；议政府提案先交理政府可作修正案齐交行政府也可作修正案再回议政府审定其一修正案或过三分之二通过原提案；议政府过三分之二通过的提案为不需交另两府直接审定，提案最终是由议政府审定由总理签署，若拒签则十日后自动生效。修宪、公决发起案、正副总理弹劾案、主席团成员请辞除名等特大案的终审裁决需至少两府表决通过提出，主席召集，须由“三府一团（主席团）联席会议"过三分之二表决通过；各省长（或特区区长）弹劾案由至少当地两府表决通过提出，总理召集，须其当地“三府联席会议"过三分之二通过；省（特区）重大案及各市长县长区长镇长弹劾案由省（特区）至少两府表决通过提出，省（特区）长召集，须其当地“三府联席会议"过半通过。</p><p><br></p><p>9，主席团成员均为无权资政，其中最新卸任总理为国家主席（象征性国家元首），最新卸任副总理为国家副主席，国家正副主席任满后都与其余历届卸任正副总理、卸任正副议长和卸任正副理士为主席团终身资政，主席团行使礼仪特使和独立调查及巡视通报及参与特大案表决等职能【为国为民再作贡献发挥余热，填补和缓解下台后中老年生活的心理空虚和猛然变化，这一变化易产生下台后各种纠葛并影响寿命】。</p><p><br></p><p>10，新政为民选和科举有分有合的三式选举制，既顺民意而又规范于学理,  也有利于博才寡言的理论家和灵话善辩的活动家及两者兼优人才都有发辉和贡献的机会。这新政的民选与科举不受年龄，姓别、民族、党派、贫富、形象和口才等局限，公平合理，远强于现西式选举。</p><p><br></p><p>11，和平新政为士辅民主制，至今为止所有所谓民主，都是只有那些强大的党派和利益集团才有能力导向的，经科举和民选脱颖而出之贤人贤士则是民意与学理的代表，而不是某政党、社团、教派或利益集团的代表。</p><p><br></p><p>12，各民族和各具特色地区有充分自治权，一个最小的群体最小的民族或最小地区只要出智者就有出总理、议长、理士等最大摡率，远比现西式选举摡率大得多，突显平等公正。历史上曾附属过的或有民意支持的邻邦可入此大中华和平新政，无条件接受对其军事保护灾难救援和经济协助等，其有参选被选和完全自治权。全球效仿此和平新政而大同共享，可延伸扩大为联合和平新政共同体。</p><p>  </p><p>     党不执政与军不从政同理合理, 易天下太平避免社会撕裂和政变动乱，和平且安全。【若中共签署或实施本新政宣言，可能有两三年以上过渡期在签署宣言的多党群体选出的新政筹备委员会中主政，包括完成筹备期突击新科举考试及筹备大选等，为21世纪和平新政奠基。中共也可让香港立即启动先行试点，这也是解决香港大难题的一劳永逸最理想的方案。很明显，香港西式政党易争得执政权是中共不愿香港普选的最主要原因，而这一切政党社团参政议政都不执政的和平新政正是摆在中共面前的一理想台阶，是唯一圆满解决香港问提的双赢方案！而且此和平新政一经普遍传播，中共很大可能最终也在大陆只能作这一最理想选择，现在暂时不想也最好收藏这一方案。全国和全香港人要齐心协力集中精力追求新政这一可行而又避免社会动荡易于各方接受的和平政改诉求！】这中西结合不完全政党政治的高智商群体智者治国的优于现西方民主制的真正理想而先进的新型政体，让中国人也真正感受且超越美国人所一直感受的，对国家、社会及政治制度的自信和骄傲，并为包括美国在内的世界树立榜样！也是世界真正进入新和平文明世纪的里程碑。【希望大家全面广泛地讨论，求得最大共识，以创新决定全中国乃至全人类命运的21世纪和平新政】。</p><p>起草：赫连禾

； pastebin.com/ca4LpMbT ； matters.news/@halanh  </p><p>---Under the banner of Sun Yat-sen, it is the only thing that is conducive to the reunification of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, and it is easy for all parties to accept, reform the Western political system, all parties and organizations participate in politics, do not govern, integrate Chinese and Western, optimize the separation of powers, general elections and imperial examinations, wise People in power, veto full Westernization; it is the only "21st Century Peaceful New Deal" in the world that has been proven</p><p>      The demise of the Soviet Union in the 20th century and the great changes in Eastern Europe made the present mainland China at the beginning of the 21st century the most important focus of the world and the key to the development of peace and civilization in the new century. In particular, the mainland has generally exported large-scale external ideology in recent years, which shocked the entire world; countries around the world have reflected on the serious virus epidemic caused by the mainland twice in more than a decade in this century;  The deterioration of US-China relations has actually started the final cold war in the field of human ideology, and there is even a risk of hot war; there is also a great risk of triggering conflicts on both sides of the strait; Hong Kong has continued large-scale demonstrations; relations with neighboring countries in the South China Sea are strained, and world peace is seriously challenged. The mainland's economy is rapidly declining, and internal and external conflicts have intensified. The high-end feels an unprecedented serious crisis, and the high-end has even repeatedly increased to the level of preventing "party death". The United States has developed critical sanctions that prohibit the entry of high-tech chips into mainland China to contain and decay the development of the mainland, and the high-end emphasizes the "tight days" of the Mao era. In fact, the critical sanctions on such high-tech chips in the United States can only last for "a few years." IBM announced last year that quantum computers will be commercialized in a few years, and the rapid development of high technology can prove that it is possible to eliminate the need for current chips, not just relying on modern computers. , The era of diversified high-tech will begin, and at the same time a new start-up race will appear. The problem is, don't fall here in just a few years! The "21st Century Peaceful New Deal" is the only ideal and effective emergency relief. Almost everyone at home and abroad, including the CCP, is well aware that the time has come for the mainland to reform its political system, and that major changes will be the inevitable result of the current wave of public opinion. Mainland China, both inside and outside the country, and the world are working together to promote the great transformation and revival of this most populous country, which also provides the best opportunity for China to create a new political system.</p><p>     Considering the realities of various political systems and countries, the vast majority of countries have chosen Western political systems for reforms or major changes. However, the increasingly obvious defects inherent in Western political systems have become reasons for attack, rejection or suspicion. This is also the reason why the leftists who tolerate dictators in Western countries have been elected to power in recent years; it is the manifestation and reason why voters have lost confidence.  Not only that, but the shortcomings of the current Western political system include: it is difficult to produce the best decisions and most of them are neither good nor inferior. The compromise plan after deliberate confrontation makes governance unsatisfactory and voters lose confidence; consortia and business giants have too much influence on politics ; Political parties take turns in power, frequent changes in decision-making, waste of manpower and financial resources, chaos, and voters easily lose confidence;  It is not just a few people, but a few parties and several large groups that compete for the highest power. Strong confrontation tends to tear society apart and make voters disappointed. In addition, there are campaigns that are eloquent and fund-oriented, which is not conducive to talented theorists. , And are not conducive to candidates who are not funded by large consortia; most talented but not eloquent candidates are easily defeated by candidates who are merely eloquent, etc.;  The most obvious example is the complete failure of Western-style polity in countries like Iraq, and it is unable to solve the problem of multi-party and multi-sectarian peaceful governance. There are also Russia, the United States, Britain, France, Germany and other Western and even world governments. The most high-end politicians and leftists in the media were secretly bribed by the global backstage of organizations such as the ultra-left Antifa. The "magic pill" of corruption used by the ultra-left not only bribed a group of senior officials in mainland China, but also bribed a large number of senior officials from various countries for a long time.   Bribery of important members of the United Nations Human Rights Organization, the World Health Organization, the U.S. parties and the Voice of America is to defend corruption or to serve corruption governance. The U.S. government, business, media, and other modern underworld forces were secretly bribed by the ultra-left global backstage. They appeared when Clinton was in power, and when Obama and Biden were in power, the underworld forces were fully developed. The U.S. government, business, media, and other institutions and departments have almost all been bribed by the ultra-left, which is very likely to overthrow the U.S. system.   Dark and evil party politics such as "Kennedy's Death", "Obama Gate", "Hillary Mail Gate" and "Biden Father and Son Gate" dark and ugly events one after another, the most typical Obama, Biden, He Jinli and others Private companies were bribed by the extreme left and the governments of other countries. Obama even hinted that he would leave the United States and go to Canada to evade accountability. The world should pay close attention! There is also the old Bush of the Republican Party in the early years that even tolerated the shocking incidents of dictators massacring people for trade and personal gain.  They are all for the purpose of fighting against political opponents and discarding principles for their personal and political interests, regardless of national interests; even some city councils in the United States have adopted absurd measures such as abolishing police stations or establishing short-lived ultra-left governments, and street riots are more likely to occur in election years; Kissinger was also bought to Chongqing to support the ultra-left Bo Xilai, singing red songs to serve the ultra-left many times, even more absurd.  Especially in the 2020 U.S. presidential election, the extreme practice of the Democratic Party and most U.S. politicians and media after being bribed by the global ultra-left general backstage for a long time can be described as the "Cultural Revolution" 2.0 international version. In the crisis and shocking the United States and the world, Obama and Biden are evil. Power and terror control the 2020 elections, highlighting the US constitutional crisis, and the death of party politics will set off the "21st Century New Deal" fever.  However, governing a country with a Western-style regime is not an ideal system for peacefully judging the good for the country and the people. The Western-style regime is bound to be reformed and perfected, making it more necessary to focus on the development of Sun Yat-sen’s examination and supervision. Reforming the Western-style political system All political parties and organizations participate in politics and do not govern. The combination of Chinese and Western parties optimizes the separation of five powers and the election of the people and the rule of the imperial examination.  In addition, the United States is infinitely proliferating mixed races, and the country is gray-ethnic. The result is obvious. In a few years, the United States will have no white people, yellow people and black people, all gray-skinned people. It is an example of the disappearance of a purebred person. The United States can still do the same, and other countries cannot learn from it. The protection of species, especially races, is the most important thing for mankind. It is aimed at a colorful and perfect future for mankind. It also proves that the "American model" is not the best example.  There is no need to imitate the Taiwanese model that is detrimental to peace and threatening regional security. Taiwan is prone to earthquakes, and independence is to cut off ancestors. Japan is also an earthquake-prone island. From the modern history of Japan, it can be seen that many senior decision-makers have ambitions for expansion, invading South and North Korea, and invading China and other land, because they know that their descendants will eventually die in an earthquake; the probability of extinction Great, but also out of selfishness and brutal invasion of the mainland and other places, uneasy on the Japanese island. However, the pro-Japanese Lee Teng-hui went to create something that would tear the society apart, which is detrimental to peace. The crisis after Taiwan’s independence and annihilation would lead to the extinction of many families and only cater to the lack of vision, which would be detrimental to regional and global security.  </p><p>      The turbulent US 2020 election that shook the world also revealed the crisis of human faith in the early 21st century. The confrontation between atheism and theism and the extreme right and the extreme left has reached the extreme of a life and death duel. In fact, similar to the pioneering work of man overcoming nature, there are unnatural or supernatural "divine" powers. Man cannot think of himself as the extreme height. In the infinite, "man" and "nature" are limited definitions.  But this "god" or "incarnation" will not be a mortal human being, and all living Buddha myths are fictitious. The concept of "N-order universe" or "N-order world" can be introduced. Whenever the known micro world is regarded as the N1 order of N, and the macro world is regarded as the Nn order of N, then humans can only recognize the N1 to Nn orders. In addition, N-1, N-2, N-3... and N+1, N+2, N+3... and so on are never known.   Different observation and analysis methods will have different forms and laws and other limitations. Therefore, it is worth emphasizing that substance and truth are the sum of infinite scientific descriptions under limited conditions, which is infinite. Life is only one of the infinite forms of material movement and existence. The "unknown life", "super life" or the limit of super life, namely "god" in the unknown micro-world and the unknown macro-world, cannot be defined and analyzed by the known life And look for it. In other words, human beings can continuously discover and acquire such knowledge, but will not eventually find the limit "gene" below the cell gene or the limit "superman" above the superman.   Discovering and finding out the rules is sacred and wonderful, and there must be mistakes in the exploration and there is value in it. For those who believe in God may wish to guess: the Tangshan earthquake, the constant earthquakes in Japan and Taiwan, may be that God knows the danger of extreme leftism, militarism and Taiwan independence tearing up society. The Chinese often say "God has eyes", this It is the conclusion of the "law of incomplete induction", I think "God is also ruthless", at least it cannot be the same as the definition of human emotion.  Only by accumulating virtue can one feel at ease. For thousands of years, mainland China is a solid base for Chinese ancestors. Just like the earth is a base for mankind, it should be preserved and cannot be divided or destroyed. Everything needs peace, everything is based on science, everything is for development. With the development of civilization and education in the new century, the rule of law and morality should be combined. The existence of the rule of law aims to maintain social morality, and the social governance of public law and morality should be combined, that is, the rule of law and morality should be combined; The combination of people and scholars, public opinion and academic theory, such as popular elections and scholars’ imperial examinations; the combination of Eastern and Western civilizations and various ethnic cultures, to create a new 21st century of rapid development.</p><p>     China is the key to the development of peace and civilization in the new century. People generally hope that China's major changes should be peacefully transitioned to avoid paying huge social resources and heavy costs. Social changes in the new century will even stop killings and bloodshed. It is aimed at more Chinese people on the left to welcome and accept those that are not fully Westernized and are conducive to the peaceful reunification of the two sides of the strait. The best choice must be to gather together under the banner of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, who has always been respected by the Chinese Communist Party. Develop Sun Yat-sen's system and implement the "21st Century Peaceful New Deal" advocated in this article。 This mission is fulfilled by the CCP’s true reformists, which will minimize the cost. It should arouse their attention and persuade them to take courage for the country and the people. Regression is a dead end, a sinner who has been stinking for years. The CCP reformists and most of the party members will not be willing to be tied up by the ultra-left regressive forces that can only gain power for a while. The first thing the CCP reformers must do is to facilitate the implementation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights signed by the CCP at the United Nations. Including the basic human rights and freedoms of the Constitution of the CCP. Only when China completes a major transformation can it be the beginning of a new peaceful civilization in the 21st century.</p><p>     Denying total Westernization, reforming the Western democratic system, adding Eastern elements, and further reforming Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Western-style party political system into incomplete party politics. In ancient China, there was a saying of "party formation for private interests". All political parties and organizations participate in and discuss politics without ruling, and there are no ruling or opposition parties, so as to avoid the complete political ills of the ruling party's own rights and interests above the state and all of it. Except for refusing political reforms and retreating is suicide, there will be no ruling party to step down, not to be overthrown, not to be eliminated, or to have the pain of being replaced by another party.  After the CCP is transformed into a non-ruling party, other Chinese political parties and associations should abandon their goal of governing and only participate in the discussion of politics. For the rejuvenation and peaceful reunification of China, they must have noble political wisdom and cultivation, and change the requirements of political parties and personal interests. Give up the desire for excessive power and change the goal of our efforts, put the interests of the people of all ethnic groups in China on both sides of the strait as the top priority and set an example for the world.</p><p>      The Chinese must all hope that China's peaceful reunification will revive a civilized, prosperous and even the strongest country. This great mission also requires the joint efforts of all Chinese, political parties, organizations, and politicians around the world. This kind of peaceful transition is the only thing under the banner of Sun Yat-sen that is beneficial to the reunification of the two sides of the strait, and is easy to accept. The combination of Chinese and Western optimizes the separation of five powers. Really implements the power of examination, the high IQ group and wise people govern the country. Incomplete party politics, denying total Westernization, the only powerful argument in the world, and the optimization of reforms and improvements can even be described as the "21st Century Peaceful New Deal" that saves the current Western political system. In other words, scholars assist the democratic "triple government" system. The separation of power is a means and cooperation is an end. Its structure is summarized as follows:</p><p>      1. Reform the separation of powers proposed by Mr. Sun Yat-sen and the separation of powers in Western style: "Three coalition government": (1) "Administrative government": first the imperial examination, and then the election by the people. , Various institutions and functions are similar to Western management; (2) "Parliamentary government": elected by the people, does not require imperial examinations, only for legislation, and its institutions and functions are similar to Western three-power parliament; (3) "Leoch Government": The imperial examination does not require elections and has multiple checks and balances. The Leoch government has the right to exercise and provide free educational institutions, medical and social insurance institutions and other rights of survival; cultural heritage institutions, private property institutions (including patents) and resource institutions (including land resources) and other asset rights; academies of sciences, think tanks and Examination agencies; judicial agencies, such as prosecutors' offices, ICAC and courts; (including newspapers and the Internet) media institutes, ICAC and supervisory agencies form a loosely integrated Leoch government. The government also has a small portion of highly specialized administrative functions, as well as some Western-style Senate functions.</p><p>      2. The term of office of each government is four years, the general election is every four years, and the new imperial examination examination is every two years. The person participating in the imperial examination must be a "doctorate" winner from a prestigious school who has passed the qualification examination of physique, integrity and other qualifications. Participate in the imperial examinations regardless of whether they are admitted or not; whether they have already served in a post, you can take up to three times. The new imperial examinations are the subjects of administration, political science, law, and economics, with supplementary questions covering all subjects. The new imperial examination is an examination of over-limit number and over-limit range test questions; as well as the ability and IQ test (this test is gradually deepened with the development of high-tech).</p><p>      3. Eventually introduce a gradually refined, fair and efficient "voting share" system, that is, voting on all important public affairs such as election referendums and proposal voting. The different "shares" of each vote shall be included in the qualifications and other items. Make all important votes of everyone more serious, especially more effective. Imperial examinations and general elections, deeds statistics, New Deal evaluations, voting shares, etc., should fully follow and use the resources and functions of the rapidly developing computer network technology to continuously improve the management level of the New Deal.</p><p>     4. The Premier of the Executive Government (and the Supreme Commander of the Military and Police): After each imperial examination, no two terms have served as Prime Minister, and a maximum of three examinations can be applied. They were ranked first in the past imperial examinations, and selected two sets of candidates for the prime minister’s running partners to elect the prime minister and deputy prime minister. The prime minister can be re-elected for a second term at most. He appointed other administrative government officials. They can be removed from office and there are no restrictions on reappointment. Among those who passed the imperial examination, the administrative heads and deputy administrative heads of provinces (special zones), cities, and counties (districts) each had two groups of running partners for each position. Applicants who pass the imperial examination in the prescribed order and are sorted and processed by computers are then elected by local voters. Other officials are appointed by the local CEO.</p><p>     5. After the chief executives at all levels are elected, they resign from the posts of the original associations and sects, without the prejudices of associations, sects and parties; flexibly choose all the best decisions of all parties and parties, not just one party. The administrative government sets up administrative agencies at the city/county (district) level, under which they appoint offices, namely township offices, town offices, and grassroots village offices and street offices. The parliamentary government and the Leoch government only have the provincial level and above. Not established; there is a permanent "patrol team" by the parliamentary government and the Leoch government, which needs to patrol according to the case, and is temporarily stationed in the county (district) government under its jurisdiction. The parliamentary government and the Leoch government can use the Internet extensively for affairs and cases (such as case registration) . To simplify the complex and bloated Western-style institutions, the concept of administrative government as "management" must have cities and counties (districts); parliamentary government and Leoch government are concepts of "legislation" and "judicial", and the Internet and its videos can be fully utilized , Streamline administration and reduce staff and abolish its city, county (district) level institutions.</p><p>      6. Candidates registered under the jurisdiction of various parties, factions, associations or personal identities can compete for members of the central parliament government and provincial assembly governments after qualification review. They are elected by the people within the jurisdiction and do not require imperial examinations. No limit. The chief and deputy heads of the parliamentary government are elected by the current members with the most votes. The total number of members of the parliamentary government plus the heads and deputy heads of the provincial assembly governments is equivalent to the number of people in the "triple government" joint meeting of the parliamentary government and the Leoch government.</p><p>     7. The main members of the Leoch government, academicians, examiners, prosecutors and judges, and the main members of the Leoch government of each province (special zone) shall be ranked according to the ranks of those who have passed the new imperial examination. For the results of the new imperial examination subjects and corresponding subjects, you can refer to the doctoral degree major or occupation of the original prestigious school. Volunteer files will be processed by computer regularly in the prescribed order, and then appointed after the list is made public. No elections, no appointments, no responsibilities, only serve the country in accordance with the Constitution and laws, and exercise rulings on all cases that do not need to be decided by the "Tripartite Government" joint meeting. It is different from Western governments and has judicial power. Supervision and inspection power is more decentralized and independent. Officials and assistants of various departments, academicians, examiners, prosecutors and judges will retire after a four-year term. Back to the Leoch government, you can accept the appointment of the Leoch government "inspection team", or other appointments other than the chief and deputy chief executive officer of the administrative government.</p><p>    8. The legislative proposals of the three governments can be submitted by a simple majority and each government participates in the review. The government proposal can be submitted to the government for amendment and then submitted to the government for review. One or more than two-thirds of the legislative proposal will be repealed; The Bank of Communications government can make amendments and then submit them to the government for review and repeal one or more than two-thirds of them; the government can submit the proposals to the government first, and the government can make amendments. The government can also make amendments and then return to the government to review the first amendment. The original proposal passed by more than two-thirds of the proposal; the proposal passed by the government of more than two-thirds does not need to be submitted to the other two governments for direct review. The proposal is finally approved by the government and signed by the prime minister. The final rulings of constitutional amendments, referendums, impeachment of prime ministers and deputy prime ministers, and the resignation of members of the presidium must be passed by at least two governments. The chairman must be convened by the"Tripartite Government" joint meeting. The second is voted through; the impeachment case of each provincial governor (or the mayor of a special zone) is proposed by at least two local governments, and the prime minister must pass it by more than two-thirds of the local ""Tripartite Government" joint meeting"; major provincial (special zone) cases and municipalities The impeachment case of the mayor of the Chang County and the mayor shall be passed by at least two provinces (special zone) through a vote. The governor of the province (special zone) shall convene it and must pass more than half of the local ""Tripartite Government" joint meeting".</p><p>       8. The legislative proposals of the three governments can be submitted by a simple majority, and each government participates in the review; the proposal passed by the parliamentary government more than two-thirds is directly reviewed; the proposal of the "executive government" is first submitted to the "Leoch government" and then to the parliament Government"; Proposals from "Leoch government" are first handed over to the "Executive Government" and then to the "Parliamentary Government"; proposals from "Parliamentary Government" are first handed to the "Leoch Government" and then to the "Executive Government"; proposals can be transferred with amendment ; The proposal is finally reviewed by the parliamentary government and signed by the prime minister. If the visa is refused, it will automatically take effect after ten days. Constitutional amendment, referendum initiation, the recall of the prime minister and deputy prime minister, the resignation of the presidium, etc., the final ruling of a very major case must be passed by at least two governments and must be passed by more than two-thirds of the "triple government" joint meeting; all provinces The long-term recall proposal shall be proposed by at least two local governments through a vote, and must be passed by more than two-thirds of the local "triple government" joint meeting; major provincial cases and the mayors, county chiefs, district heads, and mayor recall proposals are proposed by at least two provincial governments. More than half of the "Triple Government" joint meeting passed.</p><p>     9. The members of the Bureau have no power. Among them, the recently retired prime minister and deputy prime minister are the country’s "chairman" and vice-chairman. After the term of the "chairman" and vice-chairman of the country expires, they will be members of the "presidium" for life, and the other three heads of government will also serve as members of the "presidium". Be a courtesy envoy and independent investigative report, and participate in voting for very large cases.</p><p>      10. The New Deal is a three-type election system in which popular elections and imperial examinations are separate and integrated; it is not only in compliance with public opinion but also standardized in academic theory, but also conducive to "theoreticians" who are talented and not good at words; "activists" who are eloquent and eloquent; And, talented and eloquent. The elections and imperial examinations of the New Deal are not restricted by age, surname, nationality, party, rich or poor, image, and eloquence. They are fair and reasonable, far stronger than the current Western elections.</p><p>     11. The Peaceful New Deal complements the democratic system. All so-called democracy so far has been guided by only those powerful parties and interest groups. The wise men who stand out by the imperial examination and popular election are representatives of public opinion and academic theory, not A representative of a political party, association, sect or interest group.</p><p>      12. All ethnic groups and regions with their own characteristics have full autonomy. As long as the smallest group is the smallest ethnic group or the smallest region, as long as the "wise" is selected, the prime minister, chairperson, and Leoch, etc. can be produced. The greatest possibility; far more ideal than the current Western elections , Highlighting equality and justice. Neighbors that have been attached to or supported by the public in history can enter this Greater China Peace New Deal, unconditionally protect their military, rescue and economic assistance, etc., and have the right to stand for election and full autonomy. The whole world follows the example of this New Peace Deal and shares great unity, which can be extended and expanded into a "community" for the New Peace Deal.</p><p>     The party is not in power and the army is not in politics for the same reason. It makes the world peaceful, avoids social tearing and political changes, and is peaceful and safe. The combination of Chinese and Western, incomplete party politics, high IQ groups, and wise people governing the country. The real ideal and advanced new political system that is superior to the current Western democratic system allows the Chinese to truly feel and surpass what the Americans have always felt, to the country, society and politics The self-confidence and pride of the system, and set an example for the world including the United States! It is also a milestone for the world to truly enter a new century of peaceful civilization.</p><p>     Drafting: Helianhe 2019.8.6 (Eleventh revision on January 1, 2021)  起草：赫连禾   2019.8.6  （2021年1月1曰第十一次修改）</p><p>Subject to the original Chinese   （以中文原文为准）gist.github.com/Hlianhe ； pastebin.com/ca4LpMbT ； matters.news/@halanh</p><p><br></p>
