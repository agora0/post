<h1><a href="https://allpoetry.com/poem/15713789-The-autumn-day-by-Simon-Cheng-Wai-Him" target="_blank">The autumn day</a></h1><p>Block printing stamped in the color of</p><p>the moist, rainy days, of the fall</p><p>in a South Island</p><p>with overamping red.</p><p>A horse escape, from the lack of space</p><p>to the trolley, packaged with newsprint.Â </p><p>He pushes to the junkyard;</p><p>the horse yell, remains the words of</p><p>anxiety and resign,</p><p>false peace and police siren</p><p>on the Island, dry gradually.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the death of the horse,</p><p>those maggots have already house;</p><p>His bed, which I am not</p><p>accustomed to sleep well; nagging</p><p>the spelling of tearful days.</p>
