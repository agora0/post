<p>21世纪新政21st Century New

   20世纪苏联的消亡和东欧的大变革，使这21世纪初的现中国大陆成为世界关注的最主要焦点和影响新世纪和平文明发展的关键。特别是大陆这些年对外意识形态普遍大规模输出，震撼整个世界；全球各国对本世纪大陆十几年里两次引发严重病毒疫情的反思；美中关系恶化实际已打响人类意识形态领域最后的冷战甚至有引发热战危险；海峡两岸也有触发冲突大风险；香港的动荡；与南海邻国关系紧张，世界和平受到严重挑战。大陆经济急速下滑衰退，内外矛盾激化高端深感前所未有的严重危机，高端甚至反复提高到防“亡党”的严重程度。美国发展到以禁止高科技芯片进入中国大陆的要害制裁，遏制和衰萎大陆发展，高端强调过毛时代“紧日子 ”。其实美国这种高科技芯片要害制裁只能维持” 仅仅几年“ ，IBM公司去年宣布几年后量子计算机商用等等高科技飞速发展可证明，标志着可以无需现行芯片非仅仅是现行计算机的多元高科技时代将开始，新的同时起跑状态将呈现，问题是，不要在这 ” 仅仅几年“  就倒下！“21世纪和平新政”就是唯一理想而有效的救急。包括中共上下在内的几乎国内外所有人都很清楚，大陆已到必须政治体制改革的时候了，大变革将是民意世潮下的必然结果。中国大陆内外即全球正合力促成这人口第一大国的大变革大复兴，这也为中国开创新政治体制提供了一次最佳机会。中国先行，从“民主”走向“智主”，智者群体主导，并由无人智慧体系辅助主导！</p><p>       综合各政体和各国现实，绝大多数国家改革或变革选择了西方政体，但西方政体固有的越来越明显的缺陷已成为有人攻击、拒绝或怀疑的理由。这也是近年来西方国家出现了宽容那必将灭亡的独裁专制政府的左派当选，是不少选民失去信心的表现和原因。不仅如此，西方现政体的缺陷还有:  很难产生最佳决策而大多是不优不劣成心对抗后的折衷方案使施政不理想选民失去信心；财团商界巨头对政治影响过大；对立政党轮流执政决策易翻来覆去劳民伤财前后混乱选民也易失去信心; 并不只是几人而是几党几大群体竟争最高权力，强对抗易使社会撕裂更易使选民失望；另外还有竞选的形象口才和资金作用偏重，不利于博才寡言的理论家和不利于无大财团资助的竞选人；大多数博才的却不善辩的竞选人易被仅仅是形象口才好的竞选人击败等等；最明显的例子，西式政体在伊拉克之类的国家就完全失败，根本无法解决誓不两立的多党多教派的和平执政问题；还有俄国和美英法德等西方甚至世界各国政坛媒体最高端政客及左派，被极左Antifa等组织全球总后台暗地收买，极左惯用的腐败这“灵丹妙药”不仅收买拉拢一批大陆高官，还长期不断收买拉拢大批各国高官。如联合国及其人权组织、WHO、美国两党和VOA等要员被收买为腐败统治辩护或服务极为普遍。美国政坛巨商媒体等各界，在近代最黑恶势力极左全球总后台暗地收买下，在克林顿掌权时猛兴起，更在奥巴马和拜登掌权时黑恶势力普遍全面壮大，美国政坛巨商媒体等机构和部门几乎全被极左腐蚀收买，大有彻底颠覆美国体制之势。黑恶政党政治诸如“肯尼迪刺死事件”、"奥巴马门"、”希拉里邮件门“、“拜登父子门”和“佩洛西电脑门”黑暗丑恶事件一个接一个，最典型的奥巴马、拜登和贺锦丽等人及其中私家企业被极左及他国政府收买，奥巴马甚至暗示离美去加拿大逃避罪责，全球应高度关注！还有早年共和党的老布什甚至为了贸易和私利，而容忍独裁者的血腥惊世事件。他们都是为打击政敌和为其个人及政党利益而丢弃原则不顾国家利益；甚至美国有市议会通过废除警察局或成立短命极左政府等荒唐之举，选举年更易出现街头暴动打砸抢；基辛格也被收买去重庆支持极左薄熙来夺权唱红多次为极左服务，更荒谬绝伦。2020美国总统大选，两大党政客和大多数美国媒体被全球极左总后台长期全力收买后的极端做法可谓“文革“2.0国际版，在危急和震撼美国及世界的奥巴马黑帮操纵大选叛国者当总统,全球政党政治腐败已崩溃，美国宪法危机铸成恶果之后，将掀起"21世纪新政"热。        而实西式政体的治国并非利国利民的理想制度，西式政体势必改革完善，使注重发展孙中山五权分立的考试和监察更有必要。改革西式政体一切政党社团参政议政都不执政，中西结合优化五权分立(民)选(科)举智者治国，实施否定全盘西化作世上唯一强有力佐证的21世纪和平新政。此乃人类将从民主走向智主，智者群体主导并由智慧体系辅助主导！另外，美国无限泛滥混血的全国灰色人种化，结果显而易见，若干年后美国将没有白种人黄种人和黑种人，终将全是“灰色“杂交种。纯种人自寻消失，一国还可，他国不可推广，地球物种特别是人种的保护更为人类重中之重，旨为人类非灰一色的丰富多彩而圆满理想的未来，所以这一点也证明“美国模式”并非最佳榜样。各派严重对立社会撕裂不利和平威胁地区安全的台湾模式也无需效仿，地震多发地台湾的台独意识实是朝向断祖绝孙。日本也是地震多发岛屿，从日本近代史可见，多年许多决策高层都有扩张野心，侵略南北韩和中国等陆地，因为他们知道自己的子孙后代,终将会在一次地震中遇难绝后的概率极大，因此也出于私心而野蛮侵略大陆等地而不安心于日本岛。可是亲日的李登辉却与之不同，去开创撕裂社会不利和平的台独断祖绝后危局，实是一大因弃大陆而会导致许多家族断祖绝孙的短见，只迎合无远见阶层的愚眛，也对地区安全和世界和平不利。【为避免台独和中国分裂，大陆新政延用“中华民国”国名，简称“中国”仍为联合国常任理事国，并期待外蒙和原中国属地和平回归。】</p><p>      动荡震撼世界的的美国2020大选，奥巴马黑帮操纵大选叛国者当总统,全球政党政治腐败已崩溃，也揭示了这21世纪初的人类信仰危机，有神论与无神论及极右与极左的交锋已至生死决斗登锋造极。其实与人战胜自然的创举相似，非自然或超自然的"神"力是有的，人不能自以为至极，在无限之中"人"与"自然"是有限的定义。不过这个"神"或其"化身"不会是凡间人类，一切活佛神话都是虚构，可以引入"N 阶宇宙"或"N 阶世界"的概念，不论何时若把已知微观世界看成N之N1阶，已知宏观世界看成N之Nn阶，那么人类只能认识N1至Nn 阶，此外N-1、N-2、N-3...和N+1、N+2、N+3...阶等等永有未知。不同的观察和分析方法会有不同的形态和规律等局限结果。因此值得强调的是，实质与真理是无穷多的有限条件下科学描述之和，乃无穷大。生命只是物质运动和存在的无穷多形式之一. 未知微世界和未知宏世界的"未知生命"、“超生命”或超生命之极限即“神”, 都不能用已知生命来定义、分析和寻找。也就是说, 人类可以不断发现, 不断获取此类知识, 但不会最终找到细胞基因之下极限"基因"或超人之上极限"超人"。全球各宗教应就此，深化整合真实定义“天主”“上帝”等极限"超人"即“超神”的信仰，最终应合由智慧体系主导! 在人类未消灭战争和邪恶之前绝对有这整合和信仰的必要。发现和找出规律是神圣美妙的，探索必有错出错也有其价值之处。为此信神的人不妨猜想，也许唐山大震、日本和台湾不断的地震，或许是神知极左、军国主义和台独撕裂社会的危险而起的搔动吧，中国人常言"老天有眼"或许是“不完全归纳法”的结论，我看"老天也无情"，至少是它与人间对情的定义无法一样。还是积德才能心安理得，如数千年之中原大陆是华人祖宗牢靠的根据地，就象地球是人类的根据地一样应当保全，不可分裂和破坏。   </p><p>      为了世界和平本《21世纪和平新政宣言》倡导并宣告发起较长期持久性的"全球和平行动"：1，在这人类未消灭邪恶和战争之前，很有必要全球强力普及，深化整合真实定义“天主”“上帝”等极限"超人"，即“真、善、美”的“超神”信仰；2，坚持“真、善、美”这人类至今最高最基本的“普世价值”；3，禁止除斩首战犯祸首外的多死伤战争，并禁止包括炸弹、核弹、导弹、子弹和枪枝等一切爆炸性杀人武器。过去了的人间岁月一直被犯罪和战争所困惑，到处还闻得到杀人的硝烟．古代，战争使没有防卫能力的平民伤亡最多，其次是士兵，最高决策者则最安全；近代，战争有不以平民为目标的发展，平民和士兵伤亡比例有变化，但还是最高决策者最安全；进入新世纪逐步衰亡的战争应不以平民和士兵为目标，而以决策者为目标，武器应向单体目标高精度打击和复杂准确巡航的斩首方向发展，战争所付出的生命代价集中于决策者之间，只有这样战争才将会走向消亡。一切需要和平，一切基于科学，一切为了发展。</p><p>      新的世纪随文明和教育的发展，应以法治和德理相结合，法治的存在旨在维护社会公德，应以公法与公德的社会治与理相结合，即法治与德理，治标与理本相结合；以民众与学者、民意与学理相结合，如公民直选与学者科举的选与举相结合；以东西方文明及各民族文化精华相结合，开创高速发展的新21世纪，智者群体主导，并由无人智慧体系辅助主导。中国是影响新世纪和平文明发展的关键，人们也普遍希望中国大变革应该和平过渡避免付出巨大社会成本和沉重代价，新世纪社会变革更要终止杀人流血。旨在也包括左翼的更多中国人欢迎和接受的,  不完全西化中西结合的，有利两岸和平统一的，最佳选择必是都相聚在中共也一贯崇敬的孙中山先生的旗帜下，完善健全和发展孙中山的五权分立体制，实施本文倡导的21世纪和平新政。这一使命由中共真改革派完成所付代价则最小，应当引起他们的高度关注，劝其为国为民勇于担当。 倒退则是自取灭亡，必是遗臭万年的中华民族的大罪人。中共改革派和大多数党员也不会愿意被往往只可能得势一时的极左倒退势力捆绑连累，中共改革派要去做的第一件事是促成落实中共曾在联合国签署的《世界人权宣言》包括中共所立宪法的基本人权和自由。【中共也许有人会说这是使党变色，那这几十年变的色还少吗？不是那些名“社”实“资”的变色不就早和前东欧苏联一样完蛋了吗？既是如此无可否认就再变最后一次又何妨？而且已是面临无法逃避的大变革前夜，天堂与地狱只一念一步之差！“资本主义社会”其实是来源于马克思主义的贬义词，是指西方自由民主社会。】只有中国完成了顺民意世潮的大变革，才是开创21世纪全新的和平文明世界的开始。中国先行，人类将从“民主”走向“智主”，智者群体主导，并由无人智慧体系辅助主导！</p><p> </p><p>      否定全盘西化改革西方民主制，加入东方元素，将孙中山先生的西式完全政党政治较浓厚的五权分立体制，进一步改革为不完全政党政治，任何政党社团的“信念”绝不与“国策”等同，中国古代就有“结党营私”一说。所有政党社团参政议政都不执政，无执政党和在野党之分， 避免执政党自身权益高于国家及一切的完全政党政治弊病。除了那拒绝政改变革而要倒退的是主动自杀，将不会有执政党下台被动推翻消亡或执政地位被他党取代的艰险和痛苦从而长存久安。【这是中共唯一可选择的避免亡党的主动体面而又圆满的过渡,  是和平自救或重整求生的唯一有利有效的办法。包括中共在内的几乎所有世人都认为中共政治体制改革已到尽头，再真政改只会亡党或改名，这里提出的新政则是使其可不亡党也可不改名的唯一圆满理想的办法，而且在这转型过程中中共仍可能会是人数第一大党。】中共转型为参政议政党，同样如此，海内外华人其他政党社团也应放弃争取执政的目标也仅参政议政，为全中华复兴和和平统一，发挥高尚的政治智慧和修养，修改各自政党社团和要员个人的利益诉求，放弃过高权力欲望更改奋斗目标，以两岸各地全中国各族人民的利益为重，为世界树立榜样。【若如此，可以说历史进程偏偏給中共以任何政党社团都不易有的改革出新型政体真正复兴中华的优先机会，应当明智果断地把握住，失之必然逃不过亡党有的受审被彻底清算的命运。强烈呼吁大陆高端:面对严峻的政治经济和社会局势,凡能促成大陆实施"21世纪和平新政"者,不论之前政迹如何,这才是尔此生能载入史册为民做的好事,可令智蘘和专家们就此论证,机不可失!强烈呼吁大陆高端:面对严峻的政治经济和社会局势,凡能促成大陆实施"21世纪和平新政"者,不论之前政迹如何,这才是尔此生能载入史册为民做的好事,可令智蘘和专家们就此论证,机不可失!】</p><p> </p><p>      华人必定都希望中国和平统一复兴一个文明而又富强甚至为第一强国，这一伟大使命也需要全球所有华人和政党社团以及政治家们的共同努力。这可供和平过渡的，孙中山旗下唯一有利两岸统一且两岸都易接受的，中西结合优化五权分立真正落实考试权的高智商群体智者治国的，一切政党社团参政议政都不执政不完全政党政治的，否定全盘西化作世上唯一强有力论证的，及优化改革完善甚至可谓挽救现西方政体的21世纪和平新政，中国先行士辅民主的“三府合政”制，其分权为手段合政为目的，其架构概述为：</p><p><br></p><p>1，改革孙中山先生提出的五权分立和西式三权分立为三府合政: （1）由新科举考试后全民“国策”大选即“智慧”大选出的“行政府”（可简称官府），其各机构和职能与西式三权分立之行政相似；（2）民选即全民针对“信念”而大选出的，不需新科举考试的旨在立法的“议政府”（可简称民府），其各机构和职能与西式三权分立之议会相似；（3）新科举考试不需民选的具多重制衡权的“理政府”（可简称士府），理政府包括行使提供全民免费的教育院、医疗院等生存权【中共强调的】；文物院、（包括专利的）私产院和（包括国土的）资源院等资产权；科学院、（包括公德奖罚和智库的）德智院和考试院等考试权；检查院、廉政院和法院等司法权；（包括报刊和网络的）传媒院、诚信院和监察院等监察权等的，组成松散结合的理政府，因此，理政府还具有小部分专业性极强的行政功能和部分西式议会参议院功能。</p><p><br></p><p>2，每届政府任期四年，行政府和议政府的大选为四年一届次，新科举考试为两年一次。参加科举的人必须是经体检、诚信和前科等资格审查的规定范围的名校博士获得者，参加科举考试不管是否中榜任职过，最多可容许三届科举中榜。新科举考试是主题为行政科管理学、政治科法学和经济学，加辅题即全部众多学科。新科举考试是超极限数量和范围之试题的考试，和才能智商检测（此项才能智商检测跟随高科技发展逐步推进深化，最终转为全社会管理依靠于无人智慧体系辅导）。</p><p><br></p><p>3，逐步引入精细化的公正而且高效的“投票份额”制，即选举公决和提案表决等一切重要公事投票表决的，历次累积的取决于对错结果并经电脑统计出的，每人每次投票的各自不同不断变化的“份额”，并记入诚信、资历和各资格等项。使所有人所有重要投票表决更认真谨慎，特别是更为有效。科举考试及大选、政迹统计、新政评估和投票份额等等要充分紧跟并利用不断飞速发展的电脑网络技术的资源和作用，不断提高新政的管理水平。最终转为全社会管理依靠于无人智慧体系辅导。</p><p><br></p><p>4，行政府总理（兼军警最高统帅）由科举的两名排序最早的头名科举贤士申请参选总理者，为总理候选人，并在头名贤士中自主结合成两组竞选伙伴受总理级保护，再全民大选出正副总理，是两组就各政党社团的各政治议题的组合得出各自最佳的竞选纲领，交民投票选择。每次科举并大选上的总理最多可竞选连任一届；经二次和三次科举中榜并大选上可再连任。各正副部长级行政府官员由总理在对口各届科举考试合格的中榜贤士中任命，经另两府半数通过，可被辞但无再聘次数限制。各省（特区）及市县（区）正副行政长官每职位取两名，在各届科举考试合格中榜贤士中按规定届序名次经电脑处理出的申请参选人经当地选民选出，其他官员由其行政长官任命。</p><p><br></p><p>5，各级行政长官当选后辞去原社团党派教派之类职务，行政不带社团教派党派偏见，按需灵活择取各方各党各派争辩而出的非仅一方一党的全部最优决策，即无政党色彩无意识形态取向的各政党社团的各议题的组合出最佳政纲“国策”，任何政党社团及个人政见之“信念”不与“国策”等同。【避免西式体制因执政党的变更而翻来复去折腾。】只有行政府设至市县（区）级行政机构止，和其下仅设办事处即乡办镇办及基层村办街办由上级行政长官任免；议政府和理政府设至省（特区）级止其之下各级均不设立，仅由议政府和理政府常设适量“巡视组”据案需巡回暂驻于所辖市县（区）行政府院内，议政府和理政府事务及案件（如起诉立案）可广泛运用互联网。简化西式体制机构的繁杂臃肿，行政府是“管”的概念必须设至市县（区）。而议政府和理政府是“议”和“裁”的概念，完全可充分运用互联网及其视频而简政减员和废止其市县（区）级机构。</p><p><br></p><p>6，以辖内注册的各党各派各社团身份或个人身份之参选者，经资格审查后均可角逐中央议政府和各省（特区）议政府议员，经由所辖选民选出不需科举考试，当选届次不限。参加有政党色彩或有意识形态取向的议政府“信念”大选，与行政府无浓厚政党色彩无意识形态取向的“国策”大选不同。其正副议长由议政府当届议员选出得票多者担任，中央议政府议员加各省（特区）正副议长的总人数与另两府参加三府联席会议的人数相当。【不会被动推翻或消亡的而只要回归一度曾放弃暴力革命和阶级斗争等教条的现共产党，放弃违宪易撕裂社会的台独主张的民进党和孙中山开创的国民党等以及经辖内注册的海内外华人政党社团,  都可在两岸各地发展并竞选各级议政府正副议长或议员。】</p><p><br></p><p>7，中央理政府和各省（特区）理政府的正副理士、院长、考官、检查官和法官等级要员由各届新科举考试合格人士即中榜贤士，根据其新科举考试主题分数和辅题对口学科分数排名，可参照原名校获得的博士专业或从事的工作专业分类入档，定期内三志愿对口投档按规定届序名次经电脑处理再公榜后上任。不需民选，也不由行政长官任命不对之负责，只依宪法法律为国服务，并行使仅不包括需“三府联席会议"裁决的一切各案裁决，不同与西式政体，使司法权、监察权和考试权等更分权独立。每界理政府正副理士、院长、考官、检查官和法官等级要员任期四年后卸职，重新科考中榜才可连任。卸职后留理政府还原为理政府贤士，可接受理士的“巡视组”任职或属地行政府正副行政长官之外的职务任命。</p><p><br></p><p>8，立法提案三府均可经简单多数提出由各府参与审核，行政府提案先交理政府可作修正案再齐交议政府审定其一或过三分之二通过废止；理政府提案先交行政府可作修正案再齐交议政府审定其一或过三分之二通过废止；议政府提案先交理政府可作修正案齐交行政府也可作修正案再回议政府审定其一修正案或过三分之二通过原提案；议政府过三分之二通过的提案为不需交另两府直接审定，提案最终是由议政府审定由总理签署，若拒签则十日后自动生效。修宪、公决发起案、中央级弹劾案、主席团成员请辞除名等特大案的终审裁决需至少两府表决通过提出，主席召集，须由“三府一团（主席团）联席会议"过三分之二表决通过；各省级弹劾案及重大案由至少当地两府表决通过提出，总理召集，须其当地“三府联席会议"过三分之二通过；</p><p><br></p><p>9，主席团成员均为无权的资政，其中最新卸任总理为国家主席（象征性国家元首），最新卸任副总理为国家副主席，国家正副主席任满后都与其余历届卸任正副总理、卸任正副议长和卸任正副理士为主席团终身资政，主席团行使礼仪特使、独立调查和巡视通报及参与特大案表决等职能【为国为民再作贡献发挥余热，填补和缓解下台后中老年生活的心理空虚和猛然变化，这一变化易产生下台后各种纠葛并影响寿命】。</p><p><br></p><p>10，新政为民选和科举有分有合的“三式选举制”，既顺民意而又规范于学理,   既“信念”大选和“国策”（智慧)大选的对比交织进而优化，也有利于博才寡言的理论家和灵话善辩的活动家及两者兼优人才都有发辉和贡献的机会。这新政的民选与科举不受年龄，姓别、民族、党派、贫富、形象和口才等局限，公平合理，远强于现西式选举。</p><p><br></p><p>11，和平新政为“士辅民主制”，至今为止所有所谓民主，都是只有那些强大的党派和利益集团才有能力导向的，经科举和民选脱颖而出之贤人贤士则是民意与学理的代表，而不是某政党、社团、教派或利益集团的代表。最终转为全社会管理依靠于无人智慧体系辅导。</p><p>12，各民族和各具特色地区有充分自治权，一个最小的群体最小的民族或最小地区只要出智者就有出总理、议长、理士等最大摡率，远比现西式选举摡率大得多，突显平等公正。历史上曾附属过的或有民意支持的邻邦可入此大中华和平新政，无条件接受对其军事保护灾难救援和经济协助等，其有参选被选和完全自治权。全球效仿此和平新政而大同共享，可延伸扩大为联合和平新政共同体。</p><p>  </p><p>     党不执政与军不从政同理合理, 易天下太平避免社会撕裂和政变动乱，和平且安全。【若中共签署或实施本新政宣言，可能有两三年以上过渡期在签署宣言的多党群体选出的新政筹备委员会中主政，包括完成筹备期突击新科举考试及筹备大选等，为21世纪和平新政奠基。中共也可让香港立即启动先行试点，这也是解决香港大难题的一劳永逸最理想的方案。很明显，香港西式政党易争得执政权是中共不愿香港普选的最主要原因，而这一切政党社团参政议政都不执政的和平新政正是摆在中共面前的一理想台阶，是唯一圆满解决香港问题的双赢方案！而且此和平新政一经普遍传播，中共很大可能最终也在大陆只能作这一最理想选择，现在暂时不想也最好收藏这一方案。全国和全香港人要齐心协力集中精力追求新政这一可行而又避免社会动荡易于各方接受的和平政改诉求！】这中西结合不完全政党政治的高智商群体智者治国的，优于现西方民主制的真正理想而先进的新型政体，能让中国人也真正感受且超越美国人所一直感受的，对国家、社会及政治制度的自信和骄傲，并为包括美国在内的世界树立榜样！也是世界真正进入新和平文明世纪的里程碑。由21世纪新政导致人类的终极体制——从“民主”走向“智主”智者群体主导，并由无人智慧体系辅助主导！【希望大家全面广泛地讨论，求得最大共识，以创新决定全中国乃至全人类命运的21世纪和平新政】。</p><p>起草：赫连禾

The high-end even repeatedly rises to the severity of preventing the "collapse of the party". The US has developed to the key sanctions against high-tech chips entering the Chinese mainland, curbing and weakening the development of the mainland, and emphasizing the "tight days" in the Mao era. In fact, the key sanctions against high-tech chips in the United States can only be maintained for "only a few years". IBM announced last year that a few years later, the rapid development of high-tech such as quantum computer commerce can prove that it marks the beginning of a diversified high-tech era that does not need current chips, not just current computers, and a new starting state at the same time. The problem is, Don't fall down in just a few years“ The "new deal for peace in the 21st century" is the only ideal and effective emergency. Almost everyone at home and abroad, including the Communist Party of China, knows that the time has come for the mainland to reform its political system, and great changes will be the inevitable result of the tide of public opinion. Chinese mainland and abroad are working together to create a great change and great renaissance for the first big country. This also provides a best opportunity for China to create a new political system. </p><p>         Based on the reality of various regimes and countries, the vast majority of countries choose the Western regime for reform or transformation, but the increasingly obvious defects inherent in the Western regime have become the reason for some people to attack, reject or doubt. This is also the election of leftists in western countries who tolerate the authoritarian and autocratic government that will perish in recent years, which is the manifestation and reason why many voters lose confidence. Moreover, the defects of the western modern regime include: it is difficult to produce the best decision-making, and most of them are the compromise scheme after intentional confrontation, which makes the voters lose confidence in the poor governance; Consortia and business giants have too much influence on politics; The decision-making of opposing political parties in power in turn is easy to turn over and over, waste people and money, and the confusion before and after the election is also easy to lose confidence; Not just a few people, but several parties and groups compete for the highest power. Strong confrontation is easy to tear the society apart and disappoint the voters; In addition, the image, eloquence and financial role of the campaign are biased, which is not conducive to knowledgeable theorists and candidates without financial support from large consortia; Most talented but not eloquent candidates are easily defeated by candidates who are only good at image and eloquence, and so on; The most obvious example is the complete failure of the western style regime in countries such as Iraq, which can not solve the problem of multi-party and multi sectarian peaceful governance; In addition, the most high-end politicians and leftists in the political media of Russia, the United States, Britain, France, Germany and other countries in the world are secretly bought by the global general backstage of extreme left anti and other organizations. The "panacea" of corruption used by the extreme left not only buys and woos a number of senior officials from the mainland, but also buys and woos a large number of senior officials from various countries for a long time. For example, it is very common for the United Nations and its human rights organizations, who, the two parties in the United States and VOA to be bribed to defend or serve corrupt rule. Under the covert bribe of the extreme left global general backstage of the most evil forces in modern times, the black and evil forces in American politics, such as the media, surged up when Clinton was in power. Moreover, when Obama and Biden were in power, the black and evil forces generally grew in an all-round way. Almost all the institutions and departments in American politics, such as the media, were corrupted and bribed by the extreme left, which has the potential to completely subvert the American system. Black and evil party politics, such as "Kennedy assassination incident", "Obama gate", "Hillary mail gate", "Biden father and son gate" and "Pelosi computer gate", are dark and ugly events one after another. The most typical Obama, Biden and he Jinli and their private enterprises are bought by the far left and other governments. Obama even hinted to leave the United States and go to Canada to escape criminal responsibility, The world should pay high attention! In his early years, Bush Sr. of the Republican Party even tolerated the bloody world shaking events of dictators for the sake of trade and self-interest. They all abandon their principles in order to combat political enemies and for their personal and political party interests, regardless of national interests; Even in the United States, some city councils have adopted absurd actions such as abolishing the police station or establishing a short-lived extreme left government, which makes street riots, beating, smashing and looting more likely in election years; Kissinger was also bribed to go to Chongqing to support the extreme left. Bo Xilai won power and sang red for the extreme left many times, which is even more absurd. In the 2020 U.S. presidential election, politicians of the two major parties and most U.S. media have been bought by the global far left general backstage for a long time. The extreme practice can be described as the "Cultural Revolution" 2.0 international version. After the Obama Gang, which is critical and shocked the United States and the world, manipulates the election and the traitor becomes the president, the global political corruption of political parties has collapsed, and the consequences of the U.S. constitutional crisis, there will be a heat of "new deal in the 21st century".</p><p>       The western style regime is not an ideal system that benefits the country and the people. The western style regime is bound to reform and improve, which makes it more necessary to pay attention to the development of Sun Yat Sen's examination and supervision of the separation of five powers. We will reform the western style regime, and all political parties and associations will not be in power when they participate in and discuss government affairs. We will integrate China and the west, optimize the separation of five powers, run the country by the wise people elected by the people and the imperial examination, and implement a new peace deal in the 21st century that denies overall Westernization as the only strong evidence in the world. In addition, the United States has an unlimited spread of mixed race national gray race. The result is obvious. In a few years, the United States will have no white, yellow and black people, and will eventually be all "gray" hybrids. Pure people can disappear in one country, but can not be popularized in other countries. The protection of earth species, especially human race, is a top priority for mankind, aiming at a colorful and perfect ideal future for mankind. Therefore, this also proves that the "American model" is not the best example. There is no need to follow the Taiwan model of serious opposition between various factions and society, which is detrimental to peace and threatens regional security. Taiwan's sense of Taiwan independence, where earthquakes occur frequently, is actually towards cutting off its ancestors and grandchildren. Japan is also an earthquake prone island. It can be seen from Japan's modern history that over the years, many senior decision-makers have expansion ambitions to invade the land of North and South Korea and China, because they know that their children and grandchildren will eventually die in an earthquake. Therefore, they are also worried about Japan's Island by savagely invading the mainland and other places out of selfishness. However, Lee Teng Hui, who is pro Japanese, is different. To create a crisis of Taiwan independence that is detrimental to social peace, is actually a short-sighted view that abandoning the mainland will lead many families to sever their ancestors and grandchildren. It only caters to the ignorance of the visionless class, and is also detrimental to regional security and world peace.</p><p>       The turbulent 2020 election in the United States shocked the world, the Obama Gang manipulated the election and the traitor became the president, and the global political party political corruption has collapsed. It also reveals the human belief crisis at the beginning of the 21st century. The confrontation between theism and atheism and extreme right and extreme left has reached the climax of life and death duel. In fact, similar to man's creation of conquering nature, there are unnatural or supernatural "divine" forces. Man can't think of himself as the extreme. In infinity, "man" and "nature" are limited definitions. However, this "God" or its "incarnation" will not be mortal human beings. All living Buddha myths are fictional. The concept of "n-order universe" or "n-order world" can be introduced. Whenever the known micro world is regarded as n-order N1 and the known macro world is regarded as n-order NN, then humans can only know N1 to NN. In addition, n-1, n-2, n-3... And N + 1, N + 2, N + 3... Will never be known. Different observation and analysis methods will have different forms and laws. Therefore, it is worth emphasizing that essence and truth are infinite. Under limited conditions, the sum of scientific descriptions is infinite. Life is only one of the infinite forms of material movement and existence. The "unknown life", "super life" or the limit of super life, namely "God", of the unknown micro world and the unknown macro world can not be defined, analyzed and searched by the known life. In other words, human beings can constantly discover and acquire such knowledge, but will not finally find the limit "gene" below the cell gene or the limit "Superman" above Superman. In this regard, all religions around the world should deepen the integration of the true definition of "God", "God" and other extreme "Superman", that is, the belief of "Superman", and finally should be dominated by the wisdom system! It is absolutely necessary to integrate and believe before human beings eliminate war and evil. Discovering and finding out the law is sacred and wonderful. There must be mistakes in exploration, and there is also its value. Therefore, people who believe in God may wish to guess that the Tangshan earthquake, the continuous earthquakes in Japan and Taiwan, or the scratch caused by God's knowledge of the danger of extreme left, militarism and Taiwan independence tearing apart society. The Chinese people often say that "God has eyes" may be the conclusion of "incomplete induction". I think "God is also ruthless", at least it is different from the definition of love in the world. Only by accumulating virtue can we feel at ease. For example, the Central Plains has been a reliable base for Chinese ancestors for thousands of years. Just as the earth is a human base, it should be preserved and cannot be split and destroyed.</p><p>      For the sake of world peace, the declaration of the new deal for peace in the 21st century advocates and announces the launch of a long-term and lasting "global peace action": 1. Before mankind has eliminated evil and war, it is necessary to vigorously popularize the world and deepen the integration of the true definition of "God", "God" and other extreme "Superman", that is, the "supernatural" belief of "truth, goodness and beauty"; 2. Adhere to "truth, goodness and beauty", the highest and most basic "universal value" of mankind so far; 3. In addition to beheading the culprits of the first war, it is prohibited to fight a war of death and injury, and all explosive killing weapons, including bombs, nuclear bombs, missiles, bullets and guns, are prohibited. In ancient times, war caused the most casualties to civilians without defense ability, followed by soldiers, and the highest decision-maker was the safest; In modern times, wars do not target civilians, and the proportion of casualties between civilians and soldiers has changed, but they are still the highest decision-maker and the safest; In the new century, the declining war should not aim at civilians and soldiers, but at decision-makers. Weapons should develop in the direction of decapitation of single target high-precision strike and complex and accurate cruise. The life cost of war is concentrated among decision-makers. Only in this way will the war die out. Everything needs peace, everything is based on science and everything is for development.</p><p>In the new century, with the development of civilization and education, we should combine the rule of law with morality and reason. The existence of the rule of law aims to maintain social morality. We should combine the social governance and reason of public law and morality, that is, the rule of law and morality, and the treatment of symptoms and root causes; The combination of people and scholars, public opinion and academic theory, such as the combination of citizen direct election and scholar imperial examination; With the combination of eastern and Western civilizations and the essence of all ethnic cultures, a new high speed development of the new twenty-first Century led by a wise group led to an unmanned intelligent system. China is the key to the development of peaceful civilization in the new century. People also generally hope that China's great changes should make a peaceful transition to avoid paying huge social costs and heavy costs, and the social changes in the new century should put an end to bloodshed. The best choice is to gather under the banner of Dr. Sun Yat Sen, who has always been respected by the Communist Party of China, improve and develop Dr. Sun Yat Sen's three-dimensional system of five powers, and implement the new deal of peace in the 21st century advocated in this paper. This mission is completed by the true reformers of the Communist Party of China, and the cost is the least. They should pay close attention to it and persuade them to bear it for the country and the people. Retrogression is self destruction and must be the great sin of the Chinese nation. The Chinese Communist reformers and most party members are not willing to be tied up and implicated by the extreme left retrogressive forces that are often only likely to gain power for a while. The first thing the Chinese Communist reformers want to do is to promote the implementation of the Universal Declaration of human rights signed by the Chinese Communist Party at the United Nations, including the basic human rights and freedoms of the constitution established by the Chinese Communist Party. Only when China completes the great changes that conform to the trend of public opinion will it be the beginning of creating a new peaceful and civilized world in the 21st century. </p><p>     Denying the overall westernization, reforming western democracy, adding Oriental elements, and further reforming Dr. Sun Yat Sen's three-dimensional system of five powers with strong Western-style complete party politics into incomplete party politics. The "faith" of any political party and association is by no means equal to the "national policy". There was a saying of "forming a party for personal gain" in ancient China. All political parties and associations are not in power when they participate in and discuss state affairs, and there is no distinction between the ruling party and the opposition party. We should avoid the political ills of the ruling party whose rights and interests are higher than the state and everything. Except that those who refuse to change the political reform and want to regress are active suicide, there will be no danger and pain of the ruling party stepping down, passively overthrowing and disappearing, or the ruling position being replaced by other parties, so as to remain safe for a long time. The Communist Party of China has transformed into a party participating in and discussing state affairs. Similarly, other Chinese political parties and associations at home and abroad should give up their goal of striving for governance, only participate in and discuss state affairs, give full play to their noble political wisdom and cultivation, modify the interest demands of their respective political parties, associations and dignitaries, give up their excessive desire for power and change their goals for the rejuvenation and peaceful reunification of the whole China, We should attach importance to the interests of the people of all ethnic groups on both sides of the Strait and set an example for the world.</p><p>      The Chinese must all hope that China will be reunified peacefully, rejuvenate a civilized, prosperous and powerful country, and even become the first power. This great mission also requires the joint efforts of all Chinese, political parties, associations and politicians around the world. This is the only intelligent group under Sun Yat Sen that is conducive to cross-strait reunification and acceptable to both sides of the Strait, that optimizes the separation of five powers through the integration of China and the west, that really implements the right of examination, that the wise govern the country, that all political parties and associations participate in politics, that are not in power, that is, incomplete party politics, and that negates the overall Westernization as the only strong argument in the world, And optimize, reform and improve the new peace deal in the 21st century, which can even be described as saving the modern western regime. Mankind will move from "democracy" to "intelligent master", dominated by the group of wise people. The "three government co governance" system of China's pioneer, scholar assisted democracy, with decentralization as the means and co governance as the purpose, and its structure is summarized as follows:</p><p>      1. The western style separation of five powers proposed by Dr. Sun Yat Sen The reform of the separation of powers into "three political cooperation": (1) the "administrative government" (hereinafter referred to as the "government") produced by the "wisdom" general election after the new imperial examination, its institutions and functions are similar to the administrative management of the separation of powers in the western style (2) universal suffrage is a legislative "consultative government" (hereinafter referred to as the "people's government"), which is controlled by all the people according to the "faith" Elected without the need for a new imperial examination, Institutions and functions are similar to the western style parliament with the separation of powers. (3) the new imperial examination does not need to elect a "rational government" with multiple checks and balances (which can be called scholar government). Rational government includes the free exercise of the right to survival of educational institutions and medical institutions by the whole people; cultural relics institutions, private property institutions (including patents) and resource institutions The property rights (including land and resources); the examination rights of academies of Sciences, moral education (including public morality rewards and punishments), think tanks and examination institutes; judicial powers, such as inspection courts, clean government courts and courts; and the regulatory powers of media colleges, integrity colleges and regulatory Colleges (including newspapers and networks) constitute a loosely integrated administrative government. Therefore, "rational government" There are also a small number of highly specialized administrative functions and some western style parliamentary and Senate functions.</p><p>           2. The term of office of each government is four years, the general election of the executive government and the deliberative government is once every four years, and the new imperial examination is once every two years. Those who take part in the imperial examination must be doctoral candidates from famous universities within the specified scope of qualification examination such as physical examination, integrity and criminal record. They can take part in the imperial examination for up to three times regardless of whether they have served in the imperial examination. The subjects of the new imperial examination are administration, management, political science, law and economics, with auxiliary questions, that is, all many disciplines. The new imperial examination is an examination of questions exceeding the limit number and scope, and a talent IQ test (this talent IQ test is gradually deepened with the development of high technology, and finally transformed into the management of the whole society, depending on the unmanned intelligence system).</p><p>       3. Gradually introduce a perfect, fair and efficient "voting share" system, that is, for all important business voting such as election referendum and proposal voting, the cumulative "share" of each person's voting depends on the right and wrong results, which is calculated by computer and recorded in the integrity project, including qualification and qualification. Make all important votes more cautious, especially more effective. The imperial examination, general election, performance statistics, new deal evaluation and voting share should fully track and make use of the resources and role of the rapidly developing computer network technology to continuously improve the management level of the new deal. The final transformation of the whole society management depends on unmanned intelligent system guidance.</p><p>       4. Prime Minister of the "executive government" (and the top commanders of the army and police) are composed of two top candidates in the imperial examination. They apply for the position of prime minister as candidates for prime minister. Among the first batch of saints, they independently form two groups of running partners, protected by the prime minister level, and then elect the prime minister and Deputy Prime Minister through national elections. It is a combination of the two groups on various political issues of different political parties and associations, Get their best election plan and submit it to the people's vote. In each imperial examination and general election, the prime minister can be re elected for up to one term; After passing the second and third "imperial examination", he can be re elected in the general election. All administrative officials at the head and Deputy ministerial levels are appointed by the prime minister from the list of sages who have passed the corresponding imperial examination. They can resign after being approved by half of the other two governments, but the number of employment is not limited. There are two chief executives and two deputy chief executives of each province (Special Administrative Region), city and county (District). Among the sages who pass the imperial examination in each term, the candidates who apply for election through computer processing are elected by local voters, and other officials are appointed by their chief executives.</p><p>          5. After being elected, the chief executives at all levels resign from the posts of the original associations, parties and sects. The administration does not have the prejudice of associations and sects, and flexibly selects all the best decisions debated by all parties and sects as needed, that is, not only one party and one party, that is, without party color and ideological orientation, but also the combination of various topics of all political parties and associations to form the best political platform "national policy", The "belief" of any political party, association or individual political opinion is not equal to the "national policy". Only the "executive government" is set up to the administrative organs at the city and county (District) level, and only its offices, namely Township offices, town offices, grass-roots village offices and street offices, are appointed and removed by the chief executive at a higher level“ "Discussing the government" and "managing the government" are set up at the provincial (Special Administrative Region) level, and no lower levels are set up. Only "discussing the government" and "managing the government" establish an appropriate amount of "inspection teams", which need to travel according to the case, temporarily reside in the "executive government" courts of the cities and counties (districts) under their jurisdiction, and the Internet can be widely used for "discussing the government" and "managing the government" affairs, and cases (such as prosecution and filing). Simplify the complexity and overstaffing of western style institutions, and "executive government" is the concept of "management", which must be set up in cities and counties (districts). "Discussing the government" and "managing the government" are the concepts of "consultation" and "Adjudication", which can make full use of the Internet and its videos, simplify administration, reduce staff and abolish its municipal and county (District) level institutions.</p><p>      6. Any candidate of a political party, faction, association or individual registered within its jurisdiction, after passing the qualification examination, They can compete for members of the central "parliamentary government" and the "parliamentary government" of all provinces (special administrative regions). They can be elected by voters within their jurisdiction without restrictions on the imperial examination and election period. The "faith" election with political party color or ideological tendency to participate in the parliamentary government is different from the parliamentary government without strong political party color and ideological tendency "National policy" elections and "executive government" elections. The "speaker" and "deputy speaker" are elected by the current members of the "parliamentary government" with more votes. The total number of "parliamentary governments" is the same as the other two governments participating in the "joint meeting".</p><p>       7. The principal and deputy "scholars", principals, examiners, prosecutors and judges of the central "scholar government" and the provincial (Special Administrative Region) "scholar government" are qualified personnel who have passed the "imperial examination" in each new "imperial examination" Subject scores and make-up examination subject scores can be ranked by referring to the doctoral majors obtained by the original famous universities, or they can also be engaged in professional classification and filing. Volunteers will be put on file three times regularly, processed by computer and published in the list according to the specified order. It does not need to be elected by the public or appointed by the chief executive. It is irresponsible. It serves only the state and exercises it in accordance with the Constitution and the law. It does not include decisions in all cases that need to be decided by the "tripartite joint meeting". Different from the Western regime, it makes the judicial power, supervision power and review power more decentralized and independent. The chief and deputy "academicians" of each "ruling government", the president, examiners, prosecutors and judges retire after a term of office of four years, and are eligible for re-election only after passing the "imperial examination". After leaving office, he will stay in the "scholar government" and can also accept appointments to posts other than the chief executive and the deputy chief executive of the executive government.</p><p>         8. Legislative proposals can be submitted by a simple majority of three governments, each of which will participate in the review and approval. The "executive government" proposal will be submitted to the "rational government", then revised, and then submitted to the "parliamentary government" for approval. The proposal of "rational government" shall be submitted to the "administrative government" for amendment, and then submitted to the "parliamentary government" for approval. After one-third or two-thirds of the proposal is passed, the proposal to abolish the "parliamentary government" shall be submitted to the "rational government" first, and then submitted to the "administrative government" as an amendment, or submitted to the "parliamentary government" for approval as an amendment. The first amendment or the proposal passed by more than two-thirds of the original proposal "parliamentary government" does not need to be submitted to the other two governments for direct approval. The proposal was finally approved by the "parliamentary government" and signed by the prime minister. If the signature is rejected, it will automatically take effect in ten days. The final adjudication of extraordinarily serious cases such as constitutional amendment, referendum, central impeachment, resignation of presidium members and delisting shall be proposed by at least two governments, convened by the chairman and adopted by the central "joint meeting" with two-thirds of the votes; Impeachment cases and major provincial cases shall be proposed by at least two local governments through voting, convened by the premier and adopted by two-thirds of the local "joint meeting".</p><p>9. The members of the bureau are senior officials without power. The latest outgoing prime minister is the "chairman" (symbolic head of state), the latest outgoing vice premier is the vice "chairman". After the term of office of the chairman and vice chairman expires, the chairman and vice chairman will serve as lifelong senior officials of the presidium together with other outgoing prime ministers and vice premiers, including the outgoing "speaker" and the outgoing "chief and deputy" rational government " person in charge. As the special envoy for the ceremony, the Bureau conducts independent investigations, patrols and notifications, and participates in the voting of special cases.</p><p>      10. The new deal is a "three type election system" that combines the popular election and the imperial examination. It is not only in line with the public opinion but also standardized in academic theory. It is not only intertwined and optimized by the comparison between the "faith" election and the "national policy" (wisdom) election, but also conducive to the opportunities for the talented theorists, eloquent activists and both excellent talents to shine and contribute. The popular election and imperial examination of the new deal are not limited by age, men and women, nationality, party, wealth, image and eloquence. They are fair and reasonable, which is much better than the modern Western election.</p><p>      11. The new deal is "scholar assisted democracy". So far, all so-called democracies can only be guided by powerful political parties and interest groups. The talents who stand out through the imperial examination and universal suffrage are the representatives of public opinion and theory, not the representatives of political parties, associations, churches or interest groups. The wise lead the team and then rely on unmanned intelligent systems to assist.</p><p>          12、 All ethnic groups and regions have their own characteristics and enjoy full autonomy. As long as there are wise people, the smallest ethnic group or region, there are also the probability of prime minister and speaker, which is much higher than the current Western election probability, highlighting equality and justice. Neighbors with historical ties or public support can join the Dazhong Huaxin peace agreement, unconditionally accept military protection, disaster relief and economic assistance, and have the right to participate in elections and complete autonomy. The world can follow and share this new peace agreement, which can be expanded and expanded into a unified new peace agreement society.</p><p>        It is reasonable that the party is not in power and the army is not in politics. It is easy for the world to achieve peace, avoid social tear and coup unrest, and achieve peace and security. Wise people govern the country better than the truly ideal and advanced modern western democratic new regime. It can make the Chinese people truly feel and surpass the American confidence and pride in the country, society and political system, and set an example for the world including the United States! It is also a milestone for the world to truly enter the new century of peaceful civilization. The new deal of the 21st century has led to the ultimate human system - from "democracy" to "intelligent leadership", led by a group of wise men, and finally assisted by unmanned intelligent systems.</p><p><br></p><p>Drafter: he Lianhe, August 6, 2019 (the first draft of the 1990s was revised on December 25, 2021)</p><p><br></p><p>【Subject to the original Chinese 】  pastebin.com/bDdKMaHx 或 matters.news/@hliagh  或 gist.github.com/Hliagh</p><p><br></p>
