<p>摘錄兩段關於「性」的部分，The diary of a young girl (The definitive edition)</p><p>MONDAY, JANUARY 24, 1944<br class="smart">Dearest Kitty,<br class="smart">A very strange thing has happened to me. (Actually, “happened” isn’t quite the right word.)<br class="smart">Before I came here, whenever anyone at home or at school talked about sex, they were either secretive or disgusting. Any words having to do with sex were spoken in a low whisper, and kids who weren’t in the know were often laughed at. That struck me as odd, and I often wondered why people were so mysterious or obnoxious when they talked about this subject. But because I couldn’t change things, I said as little as possible or asked my girlfriends for information.<br class="smart">After I’d learned quite a lot, Mother once said to me, “Anne, let me give you some good advice. Never discuss this with boys, and if they bring it up, don’t answer them.”<br class="smart">I still remember my exact reply. “No, of course not,” I exclaimed. “Imagine!” And nothing more was said.<br class="smart">When we first went into hiding, Father often told me about things I’d rather have heard from Mother, and I learned the rest from books or things I picked up in conversations.</p><p>SATURDAY, MARCH 18, 1944<br class="smart">Dearest Kitty,<br class="smart">I’ve told you more about myself and my feelings than I’ve ever told a living soul, so why shouldn’t that include sex?<br class="smart">Parents, and people in general, are very peculiar when it comes to sex. Instead of telling their sons and daughters everything at the age of twelve, they send the children out of the room the moment the subject arises and leave them to find out everything on their own. Later on, when parents notice that their children have, somehow, come by their information, they assume they know more (or less) than they actually do. So why don’t they try to make amends by asking them what’s what?<br class="smart">A major stumbling block for the adults — though in my opinion it’s no more than a pebble — is that they’re afraid their children will no longer look upon marriage as sacred and pure once they realize that, in most cases, this purity is a lot of nonsense. As far as I’m concerned, it’s not wrong for a man to bring a little experience to a marriage. After all, it has nothing to do with the marriage itself, does it?<br class="smart">Soon after I turned eleven, they told me about menstruation. But even then, I had no idea where the blood came from or what it was for. When I was twelve and a half, I learned some more from Jacque, who wasn’t as ignorant as I was. My own intuition told me what a man and a woman do when they’re together; it seemed like a crazy idea at first, but when Jacque confirmed it, I was proud of myself for having figured it out!<br class="smart">It was also Jacque who told me that children didn’t come out of their mother’s tummies. As she put it, “Where the ingredients go in is where the finished product comes out!” Jacque and I found out about the hymen, and quite a few other details, from a book on sex education. I also knew that you could keep from having children, but how that worked inside your body remained a mystery. When I came here, Father told me about prostitutes, etc., but all in all there are still unanswered questions.<br class="smart">If mothers don’t tell their children everything, they hear it in bits and pieces, and that can’t be right.<br class="smart">Even though it’s Saturday, I’m not bored! That’s because I’ve been up in the attic with Peter. I sat there dreaming with my eyes closed, and it was wonderful.<br class="smart">Yours, Anne M. Frank</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://assets.matters.news/embed/ec8da50b-fd6b-44b0-9227-4640546401a7.png" data-asset-id="ec8da50b-fd6b-44b0-9227-4640546401a7" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption><span>中国地方推し！ コネクト「おとなのための“性教育”</span></figcaption></figure><p>關於「性教育」的問題，安妮的時代，距今約80年了，同樣的問題仍然在中國存在。</p><p>媽媽只告訴女兒，每個月都會來的，需要在內褲上貼上衛生巾。<br class="smart">同時還傳播一些或惡意的，或未經證實的偏見。<br class="smart">例如，同樣身爲女性，卻站在加害者一方，灌輸女性身體“髒”的觀念。經血是髒的，衛生巾也是羞於見人的，絕對不可以讓男孩看到。<br class="smart">大姨媽來的時候肚子再疼也不會用止痛藥的，媽媽們的觀念裏面，只有喝熱水，或者所謂的中藥慢慢調理。更誇張的是，竟然散播出，結婚治痛經的謠言。</p><p>爸爸呢，在性教育中完全缺席，兒子的遺精他是看不到的，因爲從來不洗衣服。</p><p>和安妮一樣，「性」的學習和探索，來自身邊好友和自身的探索。<br class="smart">和好友分享着私密的話題，不然隻身在黑暗中摸索會太無助的。<br class="smart">痛到流冷汗，難受得想要哭，無人傾訴的孤單。<br class="smart">癢、難受、內褲不舒服，甚至懷疑是否生了奇怪的病。<br class="smart">和密友交談之下，纔松了一口氣，大家都有這樣的煩惱呢。</p><p>父母在回答孩子怎麼出生這個問題的時候，有時並不是編造美好的童話，而是隨口而出的“撿來的”“掉下來的”。<br class="smart">既然不能從父母那裏學到一般的生理知識，只好求助於好友和網絡。因此，學得怎樣就很難說了。也許，終其一生，還不知道肚臍是怎麼來的呢。</p><p>就像學校圍欄掛着「防止校園欺凌」的標語，它只流於表面。老師不知，家長不懂，就連被霸凌的學生也許都沒意識到自己是受害者。<br class="smart">而且，一旦有事件曝光，三方合謀，息事寧人，不會有“然後”。<br class="smart">「性教育」也是如此，流於紙面，依舊承受着污名化。（準確地說，是藏在生物課本的一頁<br class="smart">性的教育，應該，從兒童開始。而且，不僅是兩性，還有性別的認知。</p>
