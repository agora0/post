<p>曉波離開我們四年了，這也是翻天覆地的四年。<br>
四年前，誰能想到，政治犯、文字獄這些詞語，有一天會變得離我們這麼近。<br>
近到連這篇發⾔，都必須從獄中發出。<br>
但正正是這種時候，曉波的思想和經驗，才更為重要。</p>

<p>曉波初次繫獄的時候，比現在的我還小幾歲。他那時要面對的，可是真槍實彈的鎮壓，戰友的死別，可判死刑的重罪，舉國之力的封殺。可以說那時他所要⾯對的恐怖氛圍，比起現在的香港只有過之而無不及。</p>

<p>但他其後選擇留在國內抗爭，⽀援天安門母親尋找真相，創辦筆會捍衛獨立寫作，發起零八憲章奠定反對綱領，並⾃始⾄終筆耕不斷。他在極其艱難的環境下，持續抗爭了近三十年，出入牢獄多次仍堅守立場，⾄死⽅休。不，甚⾄是⾄死，他也在觸發著新的抗爭，啟廸著民主路上的後來者 — 就如他啟發著我⼀樣。</p>

<p>香港無疑是進入了更嚴酷的國安新時代，但現在遠遠未是終章。相反，現在才剛剛開始。新時代的抗爭模式，需要留下來的⼈去摸索，新時代的行動空間，需要在地的⼈去發掘。只要我們不放棄，就能開創新的可能。是對的事，就要堅持到底，就如中國的民主運動，是因為有像曉波這些堅守在那裡的人，才一直能維持其生命力，不致成為無根的國際博奕。</p>

<p>在地頑抗，不撤不退。</p>

<p>我們並非不知道代價；可能還有很長的路要走，可能還會有更多的⼈會犧牲會受難會被遺忘，可能我們未能親眼⾒證⼀黨專政的結束。可這⼜有什麼關係呢？像曉波這些⺠主路上的先烈，從來就沒計較這些，只是以過⼈的勇氣與堅執，為我們鋪好了來時路。</p>

<p>我們不能辜負前⼈的付出，不能辜負獄中的、流亡的、犧牲的無數⼿⾜的付出，接下來，就該我們接棒了。</p>

<p><strong>In memory of Liu Xiaobo</strong></p>

<p>It has been 4 years since Xiaobo left us.</p>

<p>Four turbulent years as they have been, but who would have imagined that we too could be this close to being the political prisoners, be jailed for writings and expressions, so much so that I now have to deliver this article from the detention centre.</p>

<p>But it is precisely at a time like this that Xiaobo's thoughts and experiences are all the more important for us.</p>

<p>When Xiaobo was in prison for the first time, he was a few years younger than I am now. What he had to face at the time was the suppression with real bullets, with his comrades being killed and with felonies subjected to death penalty. The beleaguerment was state-engineered and the dread he had to stand up against should have been way bigger than what we now face.</p>

<p>But after all, he chose to stay behind in the country to continue with the struggles. &nbsp;He supported the Tiananmen Mothers in their pursuit of the truth. &nbsp;He founded the Pen Club to defend independent writing. &nbsp;He initiated the 08 Charter, laid the premises of resistance and he wrote persistently all along. &nbsp;He had insisted for almost 30 years under the extremely difficult circumstances. &nbsp;He was imprisoned multiple times, but until the day he died, he had never compromised his principles. &nbsp;Even his death has inspired new struggles and encouraged the newcomers, just as he has enlightened me, in the pursuit of democracy.</p>

<p>Hong Kong has undoubtedly entered a new and more severe era of national security. But we are far from being in the final chapter. Quite on the contrary, this is just the beginning of a new epoch of struggles. We need all those who stay to explore the space for actions, and to stay steadfast for what is right, just like how Xiaobo has guarded and maintained the exuberance of the democracy movement in China, without it being reduced to a rootless game of the international powers.</p>

<p>Resist with obstinacy. No back down. No retreat.</p>

<p>There may still be a long way to go. Perhaps more people will have to scarify, suffer, and be forgotten. Perhaps we may not be able to witness the end of the one-party rule – but why should it matter? On the road to democracy, our forerunners like Xiaobo have never been distracted by issues of this kind. They just paved the way for us with their exceptional courage and perseverance.</p>

<p>We should not let down our forerunners for what they have paid. We should not let down our fellow brothers and sisters who are imprisoned, in exile and those who have sacrificed. It should be our turn to take over the struggles. As long as we do not give up, we can always open up new possibilities.</p>
