<p>香港中文大學學生會解散聲明</p>

<p>【中大人有緣再會】</p>

<p>半世紀以來，香港中文大學學生會與全體師生風雨同行，共同成長。作為校園內唯一獲全體同學民意授權之代表機構，學生會於一九七一年由新亞、崇基、聯合三所書院之學生代表共同創立。多年來，學生會堅持民主自治、員生共治與書院聯邦之精神，為同學、為大眾謀福祉。</p>

<p>一直以來，作為中文大學一員，我們與校方關係雖時有張馳，仍有溝通之道。即使在風雨飄搖的日子，校方依然承認學生會在校內合法地位。然而，自今年二月以來，校方宣佈停止代收學生會會費，並要求我們向政府獨立註冊，自行承擔法律責任。對此，學生會曾徵詢專業法律意見，大律師建議學生會「不需要」獨立註冊。若順應法律意見，學生會五十年之歷史恐終於此朝；否之，我們則難以自處的兩難。</p>

<p>有鑑於此，為同學最大利益著想，我們於二零二一年九月十日召開學生會聯席會議，接納學生會代表會全體代表請辭及解散中大學生會之議案。自此，歷五十一屆，堅持由民主程序產生的中大學生會，成為歷史。</p>

<p>無可奈何花落去，似曾相識燕歸來。感謝中大同學及社會各界多年來與我們同行。中大學生會雖已解散，但中大人仍在。</p>

<p>諸君珍重，有緣再會。</p>

<p>Statement on Dissolving The Student Union of The Chinese University of Hong Kong</p>

<p>【We Will Meet Again】</p>

<p>For over half a century The Student Union of The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUSU) has gone through thick and thin, always standing side-by-side with the students and faculty of our university. Jointly founded in 1971 by student representatives from the three colleges of New Asia, Chung Chi, and United, it has been the only organization mandated to represent the student body on campus. Over the years CUSU has upheld the principles of democratic and federal self-government and co-government for students, and dedicated itself to promoting the common good throughout ever-changing times.</p>

<p>As a member of the CUHK community, we have always maintained open channels of communication with the university administration. Even during the most severe challenges, the administration continued to recognize and affirm our legitimacy and legal status on campus. However, in February of this year, University administration announced that they would stop collecting fees for the Student Union starting this academic year September 2021. They also demanded that we register through government agencies instead of recognizing our registration on campus as had been the long-established practice. In response, CUSU sought professional legal opinion and was advised that “the ordinance does not apply to CUSU” for independent registration. We are now torn between following the legal advice or complying with the university administration’s demand.</p>

<p>To serve the best interest of our students, CUSU convened a joint meeting on 10 September 2021 to give the matter serious and deliberate consideration. A motion was adopted to accept the collective resignation of the student representatives of the CUSU Council and to dissolve CUSU.</p>

<p>For fifty years CUSU existed as an independent student organization whose representatives were elected through a democratic process. It is a matter of profound regret that CUSU is now history.</p>

<p>I would like to thank our students and the public for standing with us all this time. Although CUSU no longer exists as an organization, CUHKers are still here and we remain faithful to the ideals that have guided us throughout.</p>

<p>Take care.</p>
