<p><strong>亨，出入無疾，朋來無咎，反復其道。七日來復，利有攸往。--</strong> 所謂恢復，通常是指回復通達、通暢，逐漸回復交流或交通的能力，發出訊息和接收訊息都不會引發疾病，朋友來訪也不會感到膽顫心驚的不自在。反過來說，獨處時也能回復自我的心神，專注在自己行走的道路上，不會感到寂寞和無助。通常大約經過一週七日的時間來恢復，身心的運作就能順利多了。<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>初九：不復遠，無只悔，元吉。/</strong> <strong>變卦坤為地 --</strong> 因為心智有了長期性或遠距離的變化，然後纔會有意圖恢復這樣的事情。如果沒有長遠的變化，那又有什麼好後悔的呢？所謂的恢復，不過就是把分散的意識或元神再度連結起來、走出迷惘和混亂的身心狀態啊！<br>
<br>
<strong>六二：休復，吉。/ 變卦地澤臨 --</strong> 如果休息一下就能立即恢復，這是值得喜悅的。休息不見得就是什麼事情都不做，或許大熱天在涼爽的樹蔭下歇一會，或許吃喝一點合乎自己味口的飲食，或許從事一些合乎自己品味的興趣和活動。<br>
<br>
<strong>六三：頻復，厲，無咎。/ 變卦地火明夷 --</strong> 如果需要頻繁的休息纔能恢復，代表當時身體可能已經極度疲倦，正在發出嚴厲的警訊，這有什麼好意外的呢？也許有潛伏在體內的不明隱疾，或是潛在的發炎症狀或免疫反應，身體正在尋求頻繁休息和足夠能量的幫助來恢復健康呢！<br>
<br>
<strong>六四：中行獨復。/ 變卦震為雷 --</strong> 如同季節寒暑的變化一直持續著，在休息和恢復的過程中，身心的運作並沒有停止，仍然在持續的進行中。也就是說，我們只是用比較獨立的說法來看待「恢復」這件事情。其實呢！身體的新陳代謝、盈虧消長是時時刻刻都在進行的，這也是生命持續變化運轉的原動力。<br>
<br>
<strong>六五：敦復，無悔。/ 變卦水雷屯 --</strong> 既然恢復需要長久適應變化的能力，而不是回到變化之前的起點，那麼恢復的真正意義就是在於如何妥當的和持續變化的環境互相交融和轉化，這也就是所謂的敦化。有時候經過一段時間的適應，也可能會突然大幅度的轉變了體質，頓時之間很快的就恢復了。<br>
 <br>
<strong>上六：迷復，凶，有災眚。用行師，終有大敗，以其國君，凶﹔至于十年，不克征。/ 變卦山雷頤 --</strong> 藉由過度迷信的方式來恢復是自陷困境的，甚至可能導致不能忽視的災難。如果還要把過度的迷信推行到群體，最終可能導致整個文明社會的大分裂和再重組。此時，如果連信用穩固的專家和君子都把持不住，喪失了探究、推理和驗証的精神，那真是太危險了！這樣的群體可能將面臨至少十年的衰退和窒礙，許多對外的交流和探索都無法進行了。處在迷惑而找不到答案的時候，不如暫時休養身心、收集相關資訊，耐心等待進一步的確實訊息。<strong>(P.S. 此處「敗」解爲重組分裂的狀態，類似 re-combination of the destructive status 之意。)</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
"As a detecting message was sent, the detecting terminator might get the feedback-responsive message at some time from the other sensible terminator, that's the basic principle of interactive discovery."<br>
<br>
"That meant, the message of discovery might keep company with the message of recovery. And this awesome principle might be followed by some kind of ancient Hanese medical treatment to stimulate human body's immune response for curing the disease."<br>
<br>
"In the ancient Hanese pictogram words, '復' seemed like a picture of walking path with two ways or a subway’s rigid rails, you could go forward from a starting termination to the other ending termination and come back through the same path. You could safely repeat your journeys in such path as many times as you want and without missing your way."<br>
</p>
<p><strong>【圖爲「復」字的演變，本指一種可以重複往返的安全通道，古代也稱這種通道爲「复道」，甚至覆蓋著遮風蔽雨的頂蓬或建築在地下。】</strong></p>
<p>"That must not only a stable way, but also a full speedy way. By such way, you could move fast and without any doubt. That might be a reason why 'full' sounded like this Hanese word '復'. And its meaning was extended to define the fully healthy condition of the human body."<br>
<br>
"It's reasonable! If the blood flow could fluently run in the bloody pipes by its full speed and the nervous system could transmit messages without being obstructed, then the human body health might get better condition."<br>
<br>
"In fact the health was usually regarded as a constant comfortable situation, and the familiar habits of the living styles decided the stable comfort. That's why something out of the familiar habits might temporally cause the human body's uncomfortable reaction of immune response."<br>
<br>
"From this concept about recovery in 易經, actually every sensible change might cause the body and mind to face the choice of accepting or refusing the changes, even try to fight with the changes."<br>
<br>
"Sudden and unexpected change might cause the weak body feel uncomfortable, even get a disease, that's why some great global traveling times or severe climate changing times in history were also the rioting diseased times which were caused by the massive impact of the influenza."<br>
<br>
"That's why there were some words emphasized the long term adaptability is as important as escaping or fighting for surviving from all kinds of the strange diseases."<br>
<br>
"When the disease invaded human body, it could be regarded as a discovering message. If human body could respond the recovering message to the disease, then the disease might be adapted or fitted with a body and no more let the body feel uncomfortable."<br>
<br>
"As a matter of fact, In the Nineteenth Century, a famous biologist Charles Robert Darwin had ever said: 'It's not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent, but the one most responsive to change.' when he studied about the 'Origin of Species'."<br>
<br>
"So, according to the concept about recovery in 易經, it's not going back to the original situation of the past time-space, but find a way to adapt to the changing world and keep going forward to the future."<br>
<br>
"Sure! How can we reset our body and mind, and seem like a little baby was just born out of the world? It's impossible! Due to the Bible, God created the world in six days, and rested at seventh day, that's why each qua had six yaos in 易經. That meant, each change might involve six phases, and there were sixty-four major sub-changes of the great change in the world of 易經." <br>
<br>
"That's why the basic recovering period of time was usually predicted as a week in the first yao of this qua, usually the responsive activity between invading disease and the body's immune system might last seven days."<br>
<br>
"But I wonder what is the finest and perfect adaption that we can do, is there a limit that we can't move across and can't help to stop ourselves changes? We might get older and weaker in our limited ages of life, and how can we accept all of the unusual things and changes which suddenly appear in the world?"<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>在恢復的同時，由於時空環境仍然在持續的變化，所以恢復不是回到起點的初始狀態，而是回復到可以適應環境變化的健康狀態、擁有處處都能行得通的通識或常識。但是，生命的適應能力有沒有極限範圍呢？又該如何看待那些預料之外的、不尋常的事物呢？</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
"There were some words suggested the best way to deal with the endless adapting situation in last yao of this qua: Keep patient to detect and collect more information about the changes, don't rush to do anything by the rough decision which based on any kind of suspicion and superstition."<br>
<br>
"Actually, not everything in the world was real, something was fanatic, something was ridiculous or over-anxious, even illusive or hallucinatory..... That's why the next qua '無妄' was going to talk about how to prevent the delusion."<br>
<br>
"I'm very confused about this word '妄' which related to 'delusion',...... why there was a symbol of woman - '女' who carried a big empty basket - '亡' on her head in this ancient Hanese word pictogram? Did it present a subjective impression that most of the women always felt their baskets were empty?"<br>
<br>
"From the other sight-angle, It probably meant: If a man thought women were all dancing around in their dream world and without any spirit or thought in their minds to concern the real world, then he might be just falling into delusion......"<br>
<br>
"Let's stop kidding each other, I think this word '妄' might be created by a simpler principle......"<br>
<br>
"In ancient Hanese pictogram words, the woman was graphed as a young and conservative sitting female human figure. And when a woman stayed under a roof or indoor space, it had the meaning about safety, but a little anxious, this situation was marked as '安' and sounded like 'an'...... Why? Because if she didn't get the truly evidence about what happen outside the door, especially about some unusual and scaring events, she might feel safe, but still anxious, even over worry at that time." <br>
<br>
"Do you worry about the future?....... How the world will be changed by the future?"<br>
<br>
"Future?....... Don't worry about the future!..... The future always runs at full speed, we are just passengers and even cannot feel what is its real speed........."<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>One night, during sleeping time, I dreamed about a small park: </strong><br>
<br>
<strong>Children are laughing loudly, surrounding and playing the sliding board....... They repeat to climb up and slide down, again and again, without any tiredness,........until sunset and their parents call them back home.........</strong><br>
<br>
<strong>But I see a very little boy still sit on the top of the sliding board, hands hold on rails, seems like just think about something there or no dare to slide down directly...... The sky becomes darker and the air becomes colder, but no one calls him back, and no one guide him slide.......</strong><br>
<br>
<strong>I feel a little bit weird and look around there for a while, then I see a big train is suddenly roaring on the railroad toward the park, rushes across and bumps against a series of trees,...... and keeps rushing toward sliding board......</strong><br>
<br>
<strong>"Sliding down from there! Right now!..... Just loose your hands!..... Don't be scared!......" I stand up from the bench immediately, keep shouting and running to the sliding board and trying to give him some encouragement in this urgently dangerous situation,......just in several seconds,......he is disappearing.......</strong><br>
<br>
<strong>After a moment, the roaring train is getting away as a blowing wind, ..... Sliding board becomes pieces and dusts,...... then I hear a boy's laughing sound behind me...... When I turn around to look, I can't believe what a funny boy looks as same as the face myself in my childhood.</strong><br>
<br>
<strong>"You are so lucky! Boy!" I congratulate and ask him in astonishment and my head is sweating "How could you do that?...... How did you disappear from there at that moment?"</strong><br>
<br>
<strong>He stops laughing and answers in serious expression "I jumped out there through a hole!..... I saw a transparent hole in the air!......"</strong><br>
<br>
<strong>Suddenly I woke up from bed and tried to note down this dream,...... then I suspected 復 might include another possible way which still not entirely realized by physical scientists, because of 復 just sounded like 'ho' in Taiwanese......Was it an invisible path between two holes in the time-space? Black Hole or Wormhole had ever mentioned by modern physicists? Or a Holy Way with a bi-path?...........</strong><br>
