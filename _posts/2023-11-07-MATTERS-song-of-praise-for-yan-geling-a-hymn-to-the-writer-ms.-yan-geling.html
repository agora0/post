<p><br class="smart">In the land of Songjiang, where talent and spirit thrive,</p><p>The tranquil yet surging rivers and seas,</p><p>Nurtured generations of talented women and men,</p><p>The Yan family's elegant ladies,</p><p>Blossomed in the age of revolution.</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>Following the current of history, against the flow,</p><p>Where Jiangsu and Anhui meet,</p><p>Childhood memories,</p><p>The city of heaven,</p><p>Youthful days like a bean's bloom.</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>In the tumultuous years,</p><p>In a crimson safe,</p><p>Found relative tranquility,</p><p>The foundation of life,</p><p>The accumulation of thought,</p><p>In the service of the green military uniform.</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>Youth in full bloom,</p><p>Creative and brilliant thoughts,</p><p>Stunning poetry,</p><p>A decade of spirited freedom,</p><p>Rowing waves, boldly forward,</p><p>Accompanied by noble souls,</p><p>The literary road stretches ahead.</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>In that year of historical turning, from clear to cloudy,</p><p>Crossing the ocean far away,</p><p>The enthusiasm of a seeker,</p><p>The loneliness of a stranger,</p><p>The freshness of an outsider,</p><p>The loneliness of a yellow girl,</p><p>Interwoven,</p><p>Sometimes sleepless,</p><p>Sometimes in dreams,</p><p>Restless hearts.</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>She is not just herself,</p><p>She is a reflection of those Eastern scholars studying abroad for years,</p><p>A testimony of a hundred years of Chinese men and women's new journey,</p><p>She witnessed,</p><p>She heard,</p><p>She experienced,</p><p>She bore witness,</p><p>Discrimination and disputes of racial differences,</p><p>The struggles of Chinese Americans to make a living,</p><p>The various aspects of American life,</p><p>The radiance and shadow of the new continent.</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>Anna in the egg stall,</p><p>The police and criminals in Chicago,</p><p>The resilience and fragility of life,</p><p>The complexities and simplicities of good and evil,</p><p>Manifesting by chance,</p><p>Dialectically in daily life.</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>Diligent and enduring,</p><p>Enduring humiliation and bearing heavy burdens,</p><p>Young girls and small fish,</p><p>Representing the outstanding qualities of millions of Chinese daughters,</p><p>Bearing the shackles of Asian women for a thousand years,</p><p>Reflecting the gentle and feminine warmth of the world.</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>Wandering Qiao Hongmei,</p><p>Rebellious Wu Chuan,</p><p>A new generation of Chinese women,</p><p>The haze of history,</p><p>The thorns of reality,</p><p>They are entangled in freedom and adversity,</p><p>Their struggles cannot overcome the whims of fate.</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>The tragedy of a salesman and an old woman,</p><p>The emotions of fugitives and the foolish,</p><p>Various lowliness and grievances,</p><p>The margins of society,</p><p>See.</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>Representing Chinese history,</p><p>Authoring for women,</p><p>Yan Geling,</p><p>Can be called the first of the contemporary era,</p><p>The most magnificent achievement,</p><p>No need for false modesty.</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>Leaving the Americas,</p><p>And traveling to Africa,</p><p>The streets of Lagos,</p><p>The embassy's garden,</p><p>Speeding motorcycles,</p><p>Mysterious diners,</p><p>The chief's credit,</p><p>The vet's expertise,</p><p>All carry the flavor of a foreign land,</p><p>Impossible to fully describe or explain.</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>The hometown Liang Garden in a foreign land,</p><p>In the end, it's hard to leave like one's homeland,</p><p>Years of accumulation,</p><p>Recalling the past,</p><p>Exploring the homeland,</p><p>Tracing the country's history,</p><p>Thoughts overflowing,</p><p>The bright moon reflects the sky.</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>Widow Wang Puguo,</p><p>Many cranes for Little Auntie,</p><p>Men's wars cause women to suffer and sacrifice,</p><p>But women repay this unjust world with love.</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>The Thirteen Beauties of Jinling,</p><p>The catastrophe of China,</p><p>The hell of women,</p><p>The interpretation of a poignant drama,</p><p>Tears still fill the eyes.</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>"Tian Yu" (The Bathing) film,</p><p>Recalls the bitterness and despair of young educated women,</p><p>"Youth" (Fanghua),</p><p>Reveals the hardships and joys of green military service.</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>In the dangerous swamps,</p><p>Amidst the wild warhorses,</p><p>Under the soothing touch of females,</p><p>Calm and safe.</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>"Lu Fan Yan Shi" (Criminal Records) –</p><p>A grand epic,</p><p>Recalls the tumultuous events of the Republic of China like water and flames,</p><p>Completes the cruel historical records hidden and forgotten after 1949.</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>The Yellow Bell is destroyed,</p><p>The earthen pot resonates,</p><p>The style of talented scholars,</p><p>The spirit of literati,</p><p>In the midst of disaster, they are repeatedly polished,</p><p>Transformed into smooth labor reform convicts,</p><p>Tattered clothing and plagued by illness,</p><p>But their determination in old age,</p><p>Proves that their backbone never broke.</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>The love between Yan Shi and Wan Yu,</p><p>Tempered through separations and farewells,</p><p>The end of life,</p><p>Is not the end of the soul.</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>The adaptation on the screen,</p><p>Loses the themes and essence,</p><p>Lacks depth and courage,</p><p>Where is the original's classic?</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>Critiquing reality,</p><p>Sympathy for the weak,</p><p>Introducing foreign lands,</p><p>Calling for humanity,</p><p>Speaking for the second gender.</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>The one who accomplished it all,</p><p>Only one in China,</p><p>No need for debate.</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>A challenging and bumpy half of a lifetime,</p><p>Nightly walks through muddy puddles,</p><p>Internet censorship's diligent work,</p><p>Beyond the wall, the fragrance remains,</p><p>Through wind, frost, rain, and snow,</p><p>The spirit becomes even more radiant.</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>On the list of heroic women for the country and the people,</p><p>Qiu Jin, Lin Zhao, Zhang Zhixin, Iris Chang Chunru, Gao Yaojie, Guo Jianmei,</p><p>Ms. Yan stands alongside them.</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>A kind-hearted spirit,</p><p>A lively soul,</p><p>Exquisite brushwork,</p><p>Telling poignant stories,</p><p>Healing the nation's wounds,</p><p>Weaving a beautiful landscape.</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>The bustling Shanghai Bund,</p><p>The picturesque Stone Town,</p><p>Commend their daughters,</p><p>The comfortable Sichuan Basin,</p><p>The rugged Tibetan Plateau,</p><p>Yearning for their old friends,</p><p>The Yangtze River's tributaries wind for thousands of miles,</p><p>Anticipating a reunion with her.</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>Dark times won't last forever,</p><p>The tyrant will meet his end,</p><p>She will return victorious,</p><p>With new works in hand.</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>November 2, 2023,</p><p>In the 232nd year of the Republic calendar,</p><p>Brumaire Month, Macre Day.</p>
