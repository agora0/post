    <figcaption><span>Group photo of NBC’s fantasy comedy The Good Place </span></figcaption></figure><p>Have you seen NBC's philosophy fantasy comedy “The Good Place”? Yes, you usually won't see philosophy and fantasy in the same sentence. Not only does it have witted and funny lines, also does it full of good twists! All credit goes to the brilliant Michael Schur, writer of this show. Now I’d like to share 3 reasons why I think you should watch the show and fall in love with it likeI do.</p><h2>1. Funniest <strong>Philosophy</strong> Drama Ever</h2><p>From the very beginning, I’m fascinated by the philosophy debates popping up now and then throughout all 4 seasons. It’s amazing that so many hilarious gags and thought-provoking lines can co-exist and not making you overwhelmed by the usual philosophical doctrine! It’s basically “<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10959.Sophie_s_World" target="_blank">Sophie’s World</a>” in sitcom realm, using amusing scenarios to introduce philosophical concepts in our daily life. And the discussion about afterlife can also relate to popular open-course lectures “<a href="https://oyc.yale.edu/death/phil-176" target="_blank">Death</a>” by Yale professor Shelly Kagan<a href="https://oyc.yale.edu/death/phil-176" target="_blank">,</a> the show sets forth to some notions that you may reflect on more deeply.</p><h3>2. Good Old Heaven vs Demon Battle</h3><p>Enough about philosophy, do you like to watch the good old heaven vs demon battle? “The Good Place” won’t let you down, it is now my favorite together with David Tennant and Michael Sheen’s bromance fantasy “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=On0RbFjh8tI" target="_blank">Good Omens</a>” of the same topic. I have to say, the 2 casting directors did an outstanding job to gather all these brilliant actors and actresses, and all the supporting roles are just spotted-on. You have to watch all 4 seasons to know how genius they are.</p><h3>3. Dreamy Setting that Makes Life Great Again</h3><p>Probably because I watched this show in the unspeakable 2020, a year when there are too many sad stories and new-normal still seems hard to swallow. The colorful afterlife scene and forking-great costumes setting successfully created a surreal universe that makes everything hopeful again. “The Good Place” presented in a heavenly-cute tone that I haven’t seen for years since the 2007 “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVELsqFtYCk" target="_blank">Pushing Daisies</a>” (still remember how disappointed I was when it got cancelled). Art Design and Production Design team, as well as Costume Designer Kirston Mann really pulled it off!</p><p>Did I mention the show has good ending too? Rest assured that you won’t want to smash your screen at the last episode like “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlR4PJn8b8I" target="_blank">Game of Thrones</a>”. Now, pour yourself a drink, find a nice place to relax your leg, and enjoy the season 1 trailer below.📺 (Spoil alert: the show is way better than the trailer!)</p><hr><figure class="embed-video"><div class="iframe-container"><iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RfBgT5djaQw?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups"></iframe></div><figcaption><span>Season 1 Trailer of NBC's Brilliant Comedy: The Good Place</span></figcaption></figure><hr><h4><strong>Background</strong> Info:</h4><pre class="ql-syntax">• No. of Season: 4
